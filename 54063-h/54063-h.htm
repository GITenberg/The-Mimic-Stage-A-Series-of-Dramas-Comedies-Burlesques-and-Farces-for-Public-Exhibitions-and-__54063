<h2>PREFACE.</h2>

<p>The gratifying success of a previous volume of “<span class="smcap">Amateur
Dramas</span>,” and the increasing demand for pieces of a light
character suitable for representation without the usual costly
theatrical accessories, has induced the writer to prepare a
second volume for publication. Like the first, it contains
pieces which have been specially prepared for occasional exhibitions,
society benefits, and parlor theatricals, and which have
only been admitted to “the mimic stage” after having stood
the test of public approval. For their production, no scenery
is required. A moderate-sized room, having folding-doors or
hanging curtains to separate the audience from the actors;
costumes such as the modern wardrobe will easily supply, with
now and then a foray on some good old grandmother’s trunks;
a wig or two; a few pieces of chalk; red paint; and India-ink,&mdash;is
all the “extraordinary preparations” and “great expense”
necessary. For benefits, fairs, and temperance gatherings,
many of the pieces will be found particularly appropriate.
To give variety, three dialogues, originally published in “Oliver
Optic’s Magazine,” have, by the kind permission of its
popular editor, been added to the collection. Amateur theatricals
have now become a part of the regular winter-evening
amusements of young and old; and, with proper management,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span>
no more rational, pleasant, and innocent diversion can be devised.
Endeavoring to avoid bluster and rant, relying more
on touches of nature, hits at follies and absurdities, for success,
the writer trusts his little book may contain nothing
which can detract from the good name those amusements
now enjoy.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. G.</i> March Gale, if you don’t stop that catawauling,
I’ll fling this flat-iron right straight at your head.</p>

The iron would enter my soul. (<i>Sings.</i>)</p>

</div>

<p><i>Mrs. G.</i> Dear, dear! what does ail that boy? March
Gale, you’ll distract our fine city boarders.</p>

<p><i>March.</i> Not a bit of it. Don’t they come from the
great city where there’s lots of grand uproars, organ-grinders,
and fiddlers. I tell you, Mother Gale, they are
pining for the delights of the city; and I’m a public
benefactor, when, by the sound of my musical voice, I
wake in their hearts tender recollections of “Home,
sweet Home.” (<i>Sings.</i>)</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“As I sailed, as I sailed.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p><i>Mrs. G.</i> I do wish you were sailing. Now, do stop,
that’s a good boy. You make my head ache awfully.</p>

<p><i>March.</i> Do I? why didn’t you say that before: I’m
done. But, Mother Gale, what do you suppose sent
these rich people to this desolate spot?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. G.</i> It’s their whims, I s’pose: rich people are
terrible whimsical. Mr. Raymond told your father he
wanted a quiet place down by the sea.</p>

<p><i>March.</i> Blest if he hasn’t got it! It’s almost as
desolate here as poor old Robinson Crusoe’s Island.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. G.</i> Well, well! p’raps he had a hankering for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
this spot, for he was born down here. Ah, me! how
times do change. I remember the time when Abner
Raymond was a poor fisherman’s boy. Law sakes, boy,
when I was a gal, he used to come sparking me; and
he and John Gale have had many a fight, all along of
me. Well, he went off to the city, got edicated, and
finally turned out a rich man.</p>

<p><i>March.</i> You don’t say so. Why, Mother Gale, you
might have been a rich lady.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. G.</i> P’raps I might, March; p’raps I might: but
I chose John Gale; and I never regretted it, never.</p>

<p><i>March.</i> Bully for you, Mother Gale, and bully for
Daddy Gale, too. He’s a trump. But I say, Mother
Gale, isn’t Miss Kate a beauty? My eyes! Keep a
sharp look-out, Mother Gale, a sharp eye on our Sept.;
for, if I’m not much mistaken, he’s over head and ears in
love with her.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. G.</i> Goodness, gracious! what an awful idea!</p>

<p><i>March.</i> Awful! perhaps it is; but she likes it. I’ve
seen them on the rocks as chipper as a pair of blackbirds;
her eyes glistening and her cheeks rosy, while
Sept. was pouring all sorts of soft speeches into her ears.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. G.</i> Heavens and airth! this won’t do! I’ll tell
your father of this the minit he comes home.</p>

<p><i>March.</i> No you won’t, Mother Gale. Hush, here’s
the young lady now.</p>

<p class="center">(<i>Enter <span class="smcap">Kate</span>, <span class="smcapuc">R.</span></i>)</p>

<p><i>Kate.</i> May I come in?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. G.</i> To be sure you may, and welcome (<i>places a
chair, <span class="smcapuc">R.</span>, and dusts it with her apron</i>). It’s awful dirty
here.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Kate</i> (<i>sits</i>). Dirt? I have not yet been able to discover
a particle in the house. It’s a miracle of cleanliness.
Well, March, what are you doing?</p>

<p><i>March.</i> Oh! fixin’ up the lines a little.</p>

<p><i>Kate.</i> Who was singing? While I was sewing I’m
sure I heard a musical voice.</p>

<p><i>March.</i> No: did you though? Do you hear that,
Mother Gale. Miss Kate heard a musical voice. I am
the owner of that voice, and I’m mighty proud of it;
for there’s precious little I do own in this world.</p>

<p><i>Kate.</i> You should cultivate it.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. G.</i> Fiddlesticks! there’s no more music in that
boy than there is in a nor’easter.</p>

<p><i>March.</i> Now, Mother Gale, don’t show your ignorance
of music. Yes, Miss Kate, I should cultivate it;
but then, you see. I’m an orphan.</p>

<p><i>Kate.</i> An orphan?</p>

<p><i>March.</i> Yes, an orphan,&mdash;a poor, miserable, red-headed
orphan. The only nurse I ever had was the sea,
and a precious wet one she was.</p>

<p><i>Kate.</i> Do you mean to say you are not the son of
John Gale?</p>

<p><i>March.</i> That’s the melancholy fact: I’m nobody’s
son. I was found upon the sands, after a fearful storm
and a shipwreck, very wet and very hungry, by Daddy
Gale. This little occurrence was in the month of
March. Fearing, from my youth and inexperience, I
should be likely to forget the circumstances of my birth,
Daddy Gale christened me March, and it’s been march
ever since. You march here, and you march there.</p>

<p><i>Kate.</i> And September?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span></p>

<p><i>March.</i> Oh! Sept. came in the same way, by water,
a little sooner, the September before. Daddy Gale
evidently expected to complete the calendar, and have
a whole almanac of shipwrecked babbies.</p>

<p><i>Kate.</i> He is not Mr. Gale’s son?</p>

<p><i>March.</i> No, he’s a nobody, too: we’re a pair of
innocent but unfortunate babbies.</p>

<p><i>Kate.</i> Strange I have not heard this before. I have
been here nearly a month.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. G.</i> Bless your dear soul, John Gale doesn’t like
to talk about it. He’s precious fond of these boys; and
I tell him he’s afeard somebody will come and claim
’um. But he’s done his duty by them. No matter how
poor the haul, how bad the luck, he always manages
to lay by something for their winter’s schooling; and, if
ever anybody should claim them, they can’t complain
that they have’nt had an edication.</p>

<p><i>March.</i> That’s so, Mother Gale, all but my singing;
but I have strong hopes of somebody coming to claim
me. I feel I was born to be something great,&mdash;a
great singer, or something else.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. G.</i> Something else, most likely.</p>

<p><i>March.</i> Yes. I expect to see my rightful owner
appearing in a coach and four to bear me to his ancestrial
castle.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. G.</i> Fiddlesticks!</p>

<p><i>March.</i> Mother Gale, your ejaculations are perfectly
distressing. I don’t open my mouth to indulge in a few
fond hopes, but you ram your everlasting “fiddlesticks”
down my throat to choke all my soaring fancies.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. G.</i> Well, I should think your throat <em>would</em> be
sore, with all those big words.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span></p>

<p><i>March.</i> Yes, Miss Kate: I have strong hopes of
being rewarded for my blighted youth with one or more
parents of some standing in the world.</p>

<p><i>Kate.</i> I trust your hopes will be realized. This is a
strange story, and will interest my father, startle him;
for years ago he lost a child by shipwreck.</p>

<p><i>March.</i> A child,&mdash;a boy?</p>

<p><i>Kate.</i> Yes, a boy, the child of his first wife, who
left France with her infant in a ship that never reached
her port.</p>

<p><i>March.</i> Good gracious! when was this?</p>

<p><i>Kate.</i> Oh! a long, long time ago, before I was born,
for I am the daughter of his second wife: it must have
been twenty,&mdash;yes, more than twenty years ago.</p>

<p><i>March.</i> A boy, shipwrecked twenty years ago. Good
gracious, it almost takes away my breath.</p>

<p><i>Kitty</i> (<i>outside, <span class="smcapuc">C.</span></i>). Much obliged, I’m sure. You’d
better come in.</p>

<p><i>March.</i> Hallo! there’s Kitty. (<i>Enter <span class="smcap">Kitty</span>, <span class="smcapuc">C.</span></i>)
Hallo, Kitty! who’s that you are talking to?</p>

<p><i>Kitty</i> (<i>tossing her head</i>). Wouldn’t you like to know,
<em>Mister</em> Gale?</p>

<p><i>March.</i> To be sure I should.</p>

<p><i>Kitty.</i> Well, you can’t: a pretty idea, that I can’t
have a beau without being obliged to tell you who it is!</p>

<p><i>March.</i> A beau! It’s that Bige Parker: I know it
is.</p>

<p><i>Kitty.</i> Well, suppose it is, Mr. March Gale.</p>

<p><i>March.</i> I’ll just give him the biggest licking ever he
had: you see if I don’t.</p>

<p><i>Kitty.</i> What for, pray?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>

<p><i>March.</i> What right has he to be tagging after you,
I’d like to know?</p>

<p><i>Kitty.</i> Suppose I choose to let him, Mr. Gale; and
suppose I like to have him, Mr. Gale. What do you
say to that?</p>

<p><i>March.</i> That I’ll punch him all the harder when I
get at him.</p>

<p><i>Kitty.</i> Will you? You’re a pretty brother, ain’t you?
Won’t let your sister have a beau without making a
fuss!</p>

<p><i>March.</i> I ain’t your brother: you know I ain’t. I’m
a shipwrecked innocent.</p>

<p><i>Kitty</i> (<i>laughing</i>). Oh, ho, ho! you’re a pretty innocent,
you are!</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Gale.</i> Kitty Gale, stop your laughing and behave
yourself. Don’t you see Miss Kate? Where have
you been?</p>

<p><i>Kitty.</i> Oh! I’ve been over to Mrs. Parker’s.</p>

<p><i>March.</i> Bige Parker’s. Darn him.</p>

<p><i>Kitty.</i> Mrs. Parker was not at home (<i>looking slyly at
March</i>): nobody but Bige.</p>

<p><i>March.</i> I’d like to get hold of him: I’d send him <em>home</em>,
and keep him there.</p>

<p><i>Kitty.</i> Oh, dear! I am so hungry!</p>

<p><i>March.</i> I am glad of it.</p>

<p><i>Kitty.</i> Bige Parker wanted to give me a great thick
slice of bread and butter; but I knew there was somebody
at home (<i>looking at March</i>) who could spread bread
and butter better than he.</p>

<p><i>March.</i> No: did you, Kitty? you just keep still, and
I’ll bring you a slice. (<i>Exit, <span class="smcapuc">L.</span></i>)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Kate.</i> O Kitty, Kitty! I suspect you are a little
coquette.</p>

<p><i>Kitty.</i> Me! why I never thought of such a thing.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Gale</i> (<i>going to door, <span class="smcapuc">C.</span></i>). It’s about time for John
to be back. (<i>Enter <span class="smcap">March</span>, <span class="smcapuc">L.</span>, with slice of bread and
butter.</i>)</p>

<p><i>March.</i> There, Kitty, there you are!</p>

<p><i>Kitty.</i> Oh! ain’t that nice, now if I only had a seat.</p>

<p><i>March.</i> Here’s one: here’s a high old seat (<i>attempts to
lift her upon the table, burns his hand with the flat-iron,
yells, drops Kitty, and runs, <span class="smcapuc">L.</span></i>).</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Gale.</i> I told you you’d catch it (<i>takes iron from
table, and places it in the fireplace</i>).</p>

<p><i>March.</i> You didn’t tell me any such thing: I found
it out myself. Look at that (<i>shows his hand</i>). There’s
a blister.</p>

<p><i>Kate.</i> Dear me! I forgot I had a message to
deliver. Father would like to see you in his room a
moment.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Gale.</i> I’ll go right up.</p>

<p><i>Kate.</i> Where’s Sept., March: I haven’t seen him
this morning?</p>

<p><i>March.</i> I saw him off the point about an hour ago:
it’s about time he was in.</p>

<p><i>Kate.</i> Come up to my room when you have finished
your luncheon. I’ve something to show you. (<i>Exit, <span class="smcapuc">R.</span></i>)</p>

<p><i>Kitty.</i> Yes, I’ll come right up.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Gale.</i> Now, March, be careful of that musical
voice of yours while I’m gone: don’t strain it. (<i>Exit, <span class="smcapuc">R.</span></i>)</p>

<p><i>Kitty.</i> March Gale! you ain’t a bit perlite: why don’t
you give me a seat?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span></p>

<p><i>March.</i> Well, I’ll give you a seat, now the flat-iron’s
out of the way (<i>lifts her to table, where she sits swinging
her feet and eating bread and butter</i>).</p>

<p><i>Kitty.</i> Isn’t she pretty?</p>

<p><i>March.</i> Mother Gale?</p>

<p><i>Kitty.</i> Mother Gale! No: Miss Kate.</p>

<p><i>March.</i> Yes, indeed.</p>

<p><i>Kitty.</i> And she’s so rich, and dresses so fine. I suppose
she lives in a big house with a buffalo on top, and a
pizzaro, and a miranda, and all that.</p>

<p><i>March.</i> Yes, indeed, she’s very rich; but then you
just wait till my mysterious parent turns up. I know
he’s a rich man: you never heard of a shipwrecked baby
but what had a rich father,&mdash;never. Sometimes I think
he’s a rich English lord, or a French marquis, or a
Turkish bashaw. I do hope he’s a Turk: I am very fond
of Turkey.</p>

<p><i>Kitty.</i> So am I, with cranberry sauce.</p>

<p><i>March.</i> Oh, pshaw! what’s the use poking fun!</p>

<p><i>Kitty.</i> Do you know what I would do if I was rich?</p>

<p><i>March.</i> No: what is it?</p>

<p><i>Kitty.</i> I’d have some molasses on my bread.</p>

<p><i>March.</i> You won’t have to wait for that (<i>runs
off, <span class="smcapuc">L.</span></i>).</p>

<p><i>Kitty.</i> Now, ain’t he obliging. I do like to be waited
upon: and there’s plenty to wait upon me; for, between
March and Bige Parker, I’m very comfortably settled.
(<i>March runs in, <span class="smcapuc">L.</span></i>)</p>

<p><i>March.</i> Here you are Kitty (<i>pours molasses on her
bread</i>).</p>

<p><i>Kitty.</i> Oh, ain’t that sweet!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>

<p><i>March.</i> Yes, Kitty, I’ve been thinking that it’s about
time I should make an effort to find my father.</p>

<p><i>Kitty.</i> But what can you do? there is nothing by
which you can be identified.</p>

<p><i>March.</i> No, but instinct will guide me. I know, if I
once set eyes on the man who is truly my father, there
will be a come-all-overishness that will cause me to rush
into his arms, crying, “Father, behold your son!” In
the mean time I must wait.</p>

<p><i>Kitty.</i> While you are waiting, suppose you take me
down from this table.</p>

<p><i>March.</i> All right (<i>lifts her from table</i>), down you
come. I say, Kitty, what did Bige Parker say to you?</p>

<p><i>Kitty.</i> Oh! lots of sweet things.</p>

<p><i>March.</i> Darn him!</p>

<p><i>Kitty.</i> Let me see,&mdash;what did he say? He said that
the sand seemed like shining gold when I walked upon
it.</p>

<p><i>March.</i> I’d like to stuff his throat with it: perhaps
it would change the color.</p>

<p><i>Kitty.</i> He said the sky seemed filled with beautiful
rainbows.</p>

<p><i>March.</i> I’d like to paint a rainbow round his eyes.
He might see stars too.</p>

<p><i>Kitty.</i> And the water&mdash;</p>

<p><i>March.</i> Oh, confound the water! you set me on fire.
I’ll punch that Bige Parker, you see if I don’t.</p>

<p><i>Kitty.</i> Why, March, you’re jealous.</p>

<p><i>March.</i> Jealous! well, perhaps I am. But I won’t
have that Bige Parker sneaking after you: mind that,
now. And the next time I see him grinning at you, he’ll<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
catch it: mind that, too. He’s a confounded sneak, darn
him. (<i>Exit, <span class="smcapuc">C.</span></i>)</p>

<p><i>Kitty.</i> Well, I declare, March is really jealous. Now,
that’s too bad. (<i>Enter <span class="smcap">John Gale</span>, <span class="smcapuc">L.</span></i>)</p>

<p><i>John.</i> What’s too bad, Kitty? Where’s all the folks?
where’s your marm? where’s Sept.? Where’s anybody?</p>

<p><i>Kitty.</i> Where’s anybody? why, don’t you see me?</p>

<p><i>John.</i> Yes, I see you, you chatterbox. Where’s
your mother?</p>

<p><i>Kitty.</i> Up-stairs.</p>

<p><i>John.</i> Up-stairs: now, <em>what</em> is she doing up-stairs?</p>

<p><i>Kitty.</i> I’m sure I don’t know.</p>

<p><i>John.</i> Then run and find out.</p>

<p><i>Kitty.</i> Well, I suppose&mdash;</p>

<p><i>John.</i> You suppose! Now, <em>what</em> right have you to
suppose? Run and find out, quick!</p>

<p><i>Kitty.</i> Gracious, the fish don’t bite. (<i>Exit, <span class="smcapuc">R.</span></i>)</p>

<p><i>John.</i> Pretty time of day, this is. Cold, wet, and
hungry; and nobody at home. Wonder where my rich
boarder is? Having what he calls a <em>si</em>esta, I s’pose.
Well, every one to his taste; but the idea of a live man
snoozing in the house when there’s salt water, a bright
sun, and a roaring breeze outside. Bah! (<i>Enter <span class="smcap">Mrs.
Gale</span>, <span class="smcapuc">R.</span></i>)</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Gale.</i> Well, John, back again?</p>

<p><i>John.</i> Back, of course I’m back. You don’t s’pose
I’d stay out after four hours’ fishing, without a bite, do
you? Hey!</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Gale.</i> Well, you needn’t bite me. You’ve had
bad luck.</p>

<p><i>John.</i> Now, what’s the use of telling me that? Don’t<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
I know it? I tell you what, old lady, if we ain’t
mighty careful, we shall have nothing to eat one of
these days.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Gale.</i> When that time comes, we’ll begin to
complain. But with two sich boys as our Sept. and our
March&mdash;</p>

<p><i>John.</i> Now, what’s the use of talking about them
boys? What are they good for? Where’s Sept.?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Gale.</i> Off in his boat, I s’pose.</p>

<p><i>John.</i> His boat! a pretty boat he’s got. If he’s not
kerful, he’ll see the bottom afore he knows it.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Gale.</i> Our Sept.! Why, he’s the best boatman
along shore. You needn’t be scared about him.</p>

<p><i>John.</i> Not when he’s a stout plank under him. But
that skiff of his is as frail as a shingle. Where’s March?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Gale.</i> I left him here a minnit ago.</p>

<p><i>John.</i> There’s another beauty. I tell you what,
Mother Gale, I’m going to turn over a new leaf with these
boys. I won’t have so much of this shirking work.
Sept. shall sell that boat; and March&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Gale.</i> Why, you ugly old bear! what’s the matter
with you? Turn over a new leaf indeed! Well,
that’s a good one. Only this morning you were blessing
your stars you had two such boys,&mdash;the best and smartest&mdash;</p>

<p><i>John.</i> Humbug! you don’t know what you are talking
about. I tell you they’re a good-for-nothing, lazy
pair of&mdash;Hallo! here’s Raymond. (<i>Enter <span class="smcap">Mr. R.</span>, <span class="smcapuc">R.</span></i>)</p>

<p><i>Ray.</i> Halloo, Gale! back already? what luck?</p>

<p><i>John.</i> Hem! luck. Precious poor.</p>

<p><i>Raymond.</i> I’m sorry for that. But, Gale, my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
daughter has been telling me a strange story about these
boys. They’re not yours.</p>

<p><i>John.</i> Who says they ain’t? I’d like to know who’s
a better right to ’em.</p>

<p><i>Ray.</i> Well, well, I’m not going to dispute it. But I
<em>would</em> like to hear the story from your lips.</p>

<p><i>John.</i> It’ll be a precious short one, I can tell you.
Well, they <em>ain’t</em> my boys. They were shipwrecked on
the coast twenty-three years ago.</p>

<p><i>Ray.</i> Twenty-three years ago?</p>

<p><i>John.</i> Yes, exactly twenty-three years ago, in the
month of September, we were awakened one night by
the booming of guns off shore. ’Twas a black night, I
tell you,&mdash;a roaring gale, the sea dashed over the rocks
almost to our door, and the rain poured in torrents.
We hastened to the beach. Half a mile off, stuck fast
in the sands, was a ship, blue-lights burning and cannons
firing. It was no use: mortal man could not reach her
in such a sea. In the morning, scattered pieces of the
wreck, a few dead bodies, and a live baby, was all there
was left of her.</p>

<p><i>Ray.</i> A living child?</p>

<p><i>John.</i> Yes, our Sept. A precious tough time he had
of it, I can tell you: we thought he’d die; but mother’s
care and a healthy constitution brought him through, and
there is not a smarter boatmen or a better lad on all
the coast than our Sept., if I do say it.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Gale.</i> Why, John, you said just now&mdash;</p>

<p><i>John.</i> What’s the use of talking about what I said
just now? You never did take kindly to him; but I
say he’s the best lad&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Mrs. Gale.</i> John Gale, you’re stark, staring mad!
Don’t I idolize ’em both?</p>

<p><i>Ray.</i> But the other, Gale?</p>

<p><i>John.</i> Well, he came in the same way. ’Twas very
queer; but the very next March, in a blinding storm, we
were again turned out at night by the booming of guns.
Another ship in the sands; more blue lights; in the
morning, more wreck, more dead bodies, and another
live baby.</p>

<p><i>Ray.</i> March? (<i>Enter, <span class="smcap">March</span>, <span class="smcapuc">C.</span></i>)</p>

<p><i>John.</i> Yes, March; and he was a roarer, I tell you.
We haven’t had a shipwreck since: the squalls of that
brat, night after night, was enough to scare off all the ships
in creation. He weathered it; and though I do say he’s
a smart clever&mdash; (<i>sees March, <span class="smcapuc">L.</span></i>) You confounded
scoundrel! where have you been?</p>

<p><i>March</i> (<i>Aside</i>). My! touching biography. (<i>Aloud.</i>)
Where have I been? been looking for you.</p>

<p><i>Ray.</i> But, Gale, was no inquiries ever made for these
lads?</p>

<p><i>John.</i> No; and I didn’t take particular care to hunt
up their owners. If they don’t care enough for ’em
to hunt ’em up, I’m content. They’ve been well brought
up: they’re a credit to anybody. There’s a good home
for ’em here; there’s the broad ocean for their labor;
and there are honest hearts here that love ’em as their
own; and, if they’re not content, ’twill not be the fault of
John Gale.</p>

<p><i>March.</i> Hurrah for John Gale!</p>

<p><i>John.</i> Now, what do you mean by yelling in that
way, you good-for-nothing&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Mrs. Gale.</i> Smart, clever,&mdash;Hey, John?</p>

<p><i>John.</i> Now what’s the use of talking&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Ray.</i> But these lads, Gale: was nothing found about
them by which they could be identified?</p>

<p><i>John.</i> No; Sept. was well bundled up in nice soft
flannels, while March was tied up in an old pea-jacket:
but no name or marks about them.</p>

<p><i>Ray.</i> This is very strange&mdash;very strange. (<i>Enter
<span class="smcap">Kitty</span>, <span class="smcapuc">R.</span> hurriedly.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Kitty.</i> Oh, dear!&mdash;run, quick!&mdash;run, quick!</p>

<p><i>March.</i> Run quick! where, what’s the matter?</p>

<p><i>Kitty.</i> Oh, dear! I’m so frightened!</p>

<p><i>John.</i> What is it?</p>

<p><i>All.</i> Speak, speak!</p>

<p><i>Kitty.</i> Oh! do wait till I get my breath! No, no!
run quick!</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Gale.</i> Lord sakes, Kitty! what is the matter?</p>

<p><i>Kitty.</i> I was up in Miss Raymond’s room, looking
out of the window&mdash;</p>

<p><i>All.</i> Well, well!</p>

<p><i>Kitty.</i> Oh! if you don’t run quick something will happen.</p>

<p><i>March.</i> Well, well, where shall we run?</p>

<p><i>Kitty.</i> I saw Miss Kate walking on the rocks&mdash;</p>

<p><i>All.</i> Well, well!</p>

<p><i>Kitty.</i> When suddenly she slipped&mdash;</p>

<p><i>All.</i> Well, well&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Kitty.</i> And fell into the sea.</p>

<p><i>Kate.</i> Don’t be alarmed, there’s nothing the matter.
I accidentally slipped off the rock; but, thanks to dear
Sept., I am quite safe.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Gale.</i> Come right straight up to your room, and
change your clothes. You’ll ketch your death a cold.
Come right along. (<i>Leads <span class="smcap">Kate</span> off, <span class="smcapuc">R.</span></i>)</p>

<p><i>Ray.</i> (<i>seizing <span class="smcap">Sept.’s</span> hand</i>). Sept. Gale, Heaven bless
you! you’ve done a noble deed. (<i>Exit, <span class="smcapuc">R.</span></i>)</p>

<p><i>Sept.</i> Well, well, here’s a jolly spree about just nothing
at all! But, I say, March, isn’t she splendid? Do
you know, when I pulled her from the water into my
little craft&mdash;I couldn’t help it&mdash;I felt as though she
belonged to me. Yes: rich, young, beautiful as she is,
but for the arm of the rough sailor she would now be
sleeping her long sleep beneath the waves.</p>

<p><i>March.</i> Well, I dunno about her belonging to you.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
All the fish you pull out of the water are yours; but a
woman isn’t exactly a fish.</p>

<p><i>Sept.</i> No, no, not exactly, March.</p>

<p><i>March.</i> Sept., you’re a lucky dog. That’s just your
luck. I might have been on the water a month without
making such a haul as that.</p>

<p><i>Sept.</i> Well, Father Gale, my little spinning Jenny,
as you call her, has done good service to-day. Haven’t
you a little better opinion of her?</p>

<p><i>John Gale.</i> Sept., my boy, as March says, you’ve had
a streak of luck. But don’t brag about that boat.</p>

<p><i>Sept.</i> But I will, though. She is the fastest sailer
on the coast; the neatest trimmed, and the cleanest
built; and I’m proud of her. Hallo, Kitty, what’s the
matter?</p>

<p><i>Kitty.</i> Oh, dear, this is an awful world! Suppose
Miss Kate should have been drowned,&mdash;and she would
if it hadn’t been for me,&mdash;hurrying down stairs to tell&mdash;</p>

<p><i>March.</i> After she had been saved. You’re a smart
one, you are.</p>

<p><i>Sept.</i> Well, mother, all right, hey?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Gale.</i> Yes, Sept., all right. Come right here
and kiss me. You’re a dear, good, noble&mdash; (<i>hugging
him</i>).</p>

<p><i>Sept.</i> Now, don’t, mother. You’ll spoil me. You’ll
make me believe I’ve done something great instead of
my duty. (<i>Enter <span class="smcap">Mr. R.</span>, <span class="smcapuc">R.</span></i>)</p>

<p><i>Ray.</i> Kate has quite recovered. Sept. Gale, how
can I express my obligations, how reward&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Sept.</i> Now, please, don’t Mr. Raymond. Don’t say
any thing about it. If I have been the humble instrument
of Heaven in saving a life precious to you, believe
me the consciousness of duty done is a rich reward, and
I ask no other. Oh! here’s Kate. (<i>Enter <span class="smcap">Kate</span>, <span class="smcapuc">R.</span></i>)</p>

<p><i>Kate.</i> Here I am, just as good as new. Where’s
my preserver? Now, don’t raise your hand: I’m not going
to say one word in praise of your conduct. Man was
born to wait on woman; and so, sir, you will please follow
me to the rock to find my handkerchief, and see that I
don’t take another bath. Come along. (<i>Exit, <span class="smcapuc">C.</span></i>)</p>

<p><i>Sept.</i> Ay! Ay! I’ll watch you: never fear.
(<i>Exit, <span class="smcapuc">C.</span></i>)</p>

<p><i>John.</i> Mother Gale, it strikes me forcibly that if we
are to have any dinner to-day&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Gale.</i> Heavens and airth! I forgot all about
it. You, March, run and split me some wood; and you,
Kitty, peel me some pertaters; and you, John&mdash;dear,
dear, what a confusion! (<i>Exit, <span class="smcapuc">L.</span></i>)</p>

<p><i>March.</i> Come along, Kitty.</p>

<p><i>Kitty.</i> Dear me! If there’s any thing I hate, it’s
peeling taters.</p>

<p><i>March.</i> Well, you jest wait until I get my wood, and
I’ll fix ’em for you. Come along. (<i>Exit <span class="smcap">Kitty</span> and
<span class="smcap">March</span>, <span class="smcapuc">L.</span></i>)</p>

<p><i>John.</i> It strikes me, that March has a mighty fancy
for our Kitty. Who knows but what there’ll be a wedding
here some of these days? I say, Mr. Raymond,
you’ll excuse me, but I must look arter my boat.
(<i>Exit, <span class="smcapuc">C.</span></i>)</p>

<p><i>Ray.</i> Oh, never mind me! Twenty-three years ago!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
What revelation can fate have in store for me? Twenty-three
years ago, I was the possessor of a young and
beautiful wife. Travelling in France, I was hastily
summoned to America, and obliged to leave my wife,
with her infant child, to follow me: she took passage
in the ship Diana, in the summer of ’31: the vessel
was never more heard of. Every inquiry was made,
but no intelligence could be obtained. What was also
remarkable, the ship Gladiator, which sailed from Havre
on the same day, met a like mysterious fate. These boys
found on the sands,&mdash;can they be connected with this
history? Strange, strange, I never heard of this circumstance!
But twenty years ago communication was
more difficult than now; and that dreadful winter the
fearful losses by storm were never known. New ties,&mdash;another
wife,&mdash;she, too, gone,&mdash;a daughter loving and
beloved,&mdash;have stilled the longings to gain tidings of the
fate of the lost one: but this strange history awakens a
desire to learn more. I have watched them attentively,
but can see no resemblance to my lost wife in either of
their faces. Yet something tells me that this strange
meeting&mdash;this desolate place&mdash;the wrecks&mdash;the children&mdash;cannot
be accidental. I will be calm, and watch and
wait: for I believe that in one of these boys I shall find
my lost son. (<i>Exit, <span class="smcapuc">R.</span></i>) (<i>Enter <span class="smcap">March</span>, <span class="smcapuc">C.</span>, with an
armful of wood, in time to hear the last words. He drops
the wood.</i>)</p>

<p><i>March.</i> It’s coming, it’s coming! Hold me, somebody!
Hold me, especially my head, for I hear strange
sounds! I hear the roll of carriage-wheels, and oh,
there’s a piebald horse gave me a thundering kick in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
head! What did he say? “one of these boys must be
his lost son.” So, so! he’s got a lost son; and I’ve got
a lost father, somewhere. I shouldn’t wonder if we
found out we were related. I’ve seen quite a resemblance
between Mr. Raymond and myself,&mdash;the same
aristocratic air. Suppose it should be&mdash;oh! it must be,&mdash;I
never could have been left out in that cold sand,
hungry and wet, for nothing. Won’t it be gay? I long
for the time when he will disclose himself. I knew he
never could have come to this desolate spot for nothing.
And now it’s all out. (<i>Enter <span class="smcap">Mrs. G.</span>, <span class="smcapuc">L.</span></i>)</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Gale.</i> Yes, it is all out, you lazy scamp! Didn’t
I tell you to put the wood on the fire?</p>

<p><i>March.</i> (<i>Picking up wood he dropped.</i>) Now, don’t
scold, Mother Gale. There’s a fire here (<i>hand on
heart</i>).</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Gale</i> (<i>at fireplace</i>). I tell you, there’s no fire
here. What are you thinking of?</p>

<p><i>March</i> (<i>placing wood on fire</i>). “I dreamt that I dwelt
in marble halls.”</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Gale.</i> Marble fiddlesticks! O March, March!
you’ll never set the river afire!</p>

<p><i>March.</i> Won’t I, Mother Gale? You may be sure
of one thing: I shan’t try in a hurry. Shall I tell her?
no; I will keep silence, least I interfere with his plans.
(<i>Enter <span class="smcap">Kitty</span>, <span class="smcapuc">L.</span></i>)</p>

<p><i>Kitty.</i> Oh, dear! oh, dear! I’ve cut my finger with
those plaguey taters.</p>

<p><i>March.</i> Dear me, Kitty! you are always in trouble.</p>

<p><i>Kitty.</i> Well, I couldn’t help it. My hands were
never made to peel taters.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>

<p><i>March.</i> No, indeed, they wa’nt. Here, let me fix it
for you (<i>wraps cloth round it</i>). You shan’t do it again.
Fortune has at last smiled upon me: I shall soon be
rich, and then&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Kitty.</i> How long must we wait?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Gale.</i> How long must I wait for the pertaters?</p>

<p><i>Kitty.</i> Oh, dear! I wish they were in the sea (<i>goes
to door, <span class="smcapuc">C.</span></i>). O March, look here, quick! There’s a
yacht coming round the point. Isn’t she a beauty?</p>

<p><i>March.</i> My eyes! look at her! A gentleman’s yacht,
and headed this way.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Gale.</i> Mercy sakes! More visitors. Who can
it be? (<i>All exit, <span class="smcapuc">C.</span> Enter <span class="smcap">Raymond</span>, <span class="smcapuc">R.</span></i>)</p>

<p><i>Ray.</i> Confusion! That confounded Capt Dandelion,
to escape whom I fled to this out-of-the-way place,
is almost at the door in his yacht. His pursuit of Kate
is persistent; and, but that I knew the utter selfishness
of the man, I could honor him for the apparently unwearied
patience with which he follows her. (<i>Enter <span class="smcap">Kate</span>
and <span class="smcap">Sept.</span>, <span class="smcapuc">C.</span></i>) Well, child, you have heard of the new
arrival?</p>

<p><i>Kate.</i> A new arrival? No: who is it?</p>

<p><i>Ray.</i> Your persevering gallant, Capt. Dandelion, is
after you. That is his yacht just dropping anchor.</p>

<p><i>Kate.</i> Now, what could have sent him here?</p>

<p><i>Ray.</i> You don’t seem pleased. Perhaps I may have
been unkind in thought; but, remembering your partiality
for him in the city, I feared you might have clandestinely
invited him here.</p>

<p><i>Kate.</i> Why, Father! can you think so meanly of me?
Capt. Dandelion is very pleasant society in the city; but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
here I can do without him. Oh! I forgot: Sept. wants
to speak to you.</p>

<p><i>Sept.</i> Me? No I don’t.</p>

<p><i>Kate.</i> Why, Sept.! what did you tell me when we
were walking by the shore?</p>

<p><i>Sept.</i> What did I tell you? why&mdash;that&mdash;I&mdash;what
did I tell you?</p>

<p><i>Kate.</i> Come, come, sir.</p>

<p><i>Sept.</i> Well, then, I said you were very beautiful.</p>

<p><i>Kate.</i> Oh, pshaw! not that.</p>

<p><i>Sept.</i> Yes, I did; and I meant it; that you were rich,
admired and courted; that your presence here had been
like the coming of a new star in a dark night, to light
the path of us hardy fisherman; that&mdash;that&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Kate.</i> O father! speak to him.</p>

<p><i>Ray.</i> Well, Sept., I’m willing to obey; but what shall
I say?&mdash;that I fear the presence of my daughter has
made a young man forget his lowly station?</p>

<p><i>Sept.</i> Yes, you may say that: it has. It has made
him forget that he is poor, rough, and untutored,&mdash;that
there are social bonds which hold the rich within their
circles, where the poor may not enter. He has forgot
all, all this. For the manhood within him&mdash;the love of
the beautiful implanted in his breast&mdash;has burst all
slavish bonds, and his heart has forced from his lips the
words, ‘I love you!’</p>

<p><i>Ray.</i> And you have said this to my daughter?</p>

<p><i>Sept.</i> I have: I could not help it.</p>

<p><i>Ray.</i> Base,&mdash;base,&mdash;base! you have taken advantage
of having saved my daughter’s life&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Kate.</i> Hold, father! you are mistaken. He has taken<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
no advantage: I do not believe he ever thought of it. It
was I who remembered that when I said, ‘Sept., I am
glad to hear this; for I dearly, truly love you.’</p>

<p><i>Ray.</i> Confound it, girl! what have you done?</p>

<p><i>Kate.</i> Obeyed the instincts of a true woman, who,
when she gains the heart of a man noble and good,
accepts it fully and freely, caring not for wealth or
station.</p>

<p><i>Ray.</i> You’re a pair of romantic fools. I tell you,
girl, you know not what you have done. This must not,
cannot be.</p>

<p><i>Kate.</i> Oh! but it is; you are too late: the mischief
is done. So, father, give your consent and make us
happy. (<i>Enter <span class="smcap">Kitty</span>, <span class="smcapuc">C.</span></i>)</p>

<p><i>Kitty.</i> O Miss Kate! here’s somebody to see you,&mdash;a
real gentleman, with rings on his fingers and bells on
his toes, I should say, a great mustache under his nose,
and half a pair of specs in one eye; and he says “he’s
deused wearwy, ah!” (<i>imitating.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Kate.</i> That’s Capt. Dandelion, sure. (<i>Enter <span class="smcap">March</span>,
<span class="smcapuc">C.</span>, with Captain.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Capt.</i> Wall, now, wearly, what a surpwise! You
don’t know, my dear fwiends, what a search I’ve had for
you; you don’t wearly!</p>

<p><i>Ray.</i> Well, Captain, you have found us out. I suppose
it would not be polite for me to say we came here
on purpose to get rid of you?</p>

<p><i>Capt.</i> Say it, my dear fellah, say it: it’s just like you;
it is, wearly; you’re always joking. But, you know, you
can’t affwont me, ’pon my word.</p>

<p><i>Ray.</i> (<i>Aside.</i>) No: I wish I could.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Capt.</i> And how is the beautiful, bewitching, adowable
Miss Kate?</p>

<p><i>Kate.</i> Quite well, thank you, Captain. How are all
our friends in the city?</p>

<p><i>Capt.</i> Miserwable, perfectly miserwable: the sun don’t
shine in the city when you are not there; it don’t, wearly.
I couldn’t live there, and so I took my wacht and sailed
after you.</p>

<p><i>Kitty.</i> (<i><span class="smcapuc">L.</span> to <span class="smcap">March</span>, <span class="smcapuc">L.</span></i>) Took his what?</p>

<p><i>Kate.</i> Excuse me, Captain: let me present my friends.
This is Mr. March Gale.</p>

<p><i>Capt.</i> No, wearly? What a queer name! queer fish,
too, ’pon honor.</p>

<p><i>March.</i> The Captain and I have met before. He’s a
little near-sighted, and tumbled head over heels over a
rock; but I picked him up.</p>

<p><i>Kate.</i> And this is Mr. Sept. Gale.</p>

<p><i>Capt.</i> Oh! wearly, a fisherman.</p>

<p><i>Sept.</i> (<i>Takes Captain’s hand, and gives it a rough shaking.</i>)
Glad to see you, Captain, glad to see you: we’ll
make you comfortable here; plenty of fish.</p>

<p><i>Capt.</i> (<i>Grinning, and shaking his head.</i>) Fish! Yes,
and lobsters, too: I’ve felt their claws.</p>

<p><i>Kate.</i> And this is Miss Kitty Gale.</p>

<p><i>Capt.</i> Ah, wearly! (<i>Bows, puts his eye-glass to his
eyes.</i>) Positively bewitching! wuwal simplicity! Wenus
in a clamshell! (<i>To Kate.</i>) But all fisherman.</p>

<p><i>Kate.</i> Yes, all fisherman; and you’ll find me handy
with the line, too, thanks to Sept.’s teaching.</p>

<p><i>Capt.</i> Glad to hear it; quite a womantic place this;
so pwimitive, though it does smell hawibly of fish.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>

<p><i>March.</i> Yes, Captain, she’s a capital fisherman.
(<i>Aside.</i>) I do wish they would clear out, and give me a
chance for a word with Mr. Raymond. There’s something
in my bosom tells me&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Gale</i> (<i>Outside, <span class="smcapuc">L.</span></i>). March, March!</p>

<p><i>March.</i> Yes: there’s always something telling me that.
It’s nothing but March. (<i>Exit, <span class="smcapuc">L.</span></i>)</p>

<p><i>Capt.</i> By the by, Miss Kate, I have a message from a
friend in the city, Blanche Allen.</p>

<p><i>Kate.</i> Dear Blanche! give it me quick.</p>

<p><i>Capt.</i> I declare I’ve left it in my wacht.</p>

<p><i>Kate.</i> Oh! do run and get it quick. Come, I’ll go
with you.</p>

<p><i>Capt.</i> Will you? that’s deused kind of you,&mdash;it is
wearly.</p>

<p><i>Kate.</i> Come, come! I’m impatient to hear from dear
Blanche. (<i>Takes Captain’s arm, and exit, <span class="smcapuc">C.</span></i>)</p>

<p><i>Sept.</i> She seems mightily pleased with her city friend.
Well, he’s an elegant gentleman, while I’m but a rough
fisherman. Can I ever hope to win her! And yet she
told me, but a little while ago, she loved me. (<i>About to
exit, <span class="smcapuc">C.</span></i>)</p>

<p><i>Ray.</i> (<i><span class="smcapuc">R.</span></i>) Sept., a word with you.</p>

<p><i>Sept.</i> Ay, ay, sir. (<i>Comes down, <span class="smcapuc">L.</span></i>)</p>

<p><i>Ray.</i> John Gale has been telling me a strange story
about you. You are not his son.</p>

<p><i>Sept.</i> Ah, the story of the shipwreck. No, sir: I am
not his son by birth; but he has been a true father to
me, and I love him as though he were my own.</p>

<p><i>Ray.</i> Have you no recollection of a mother?</p>

<p><i>Sept.</i> None: I was an infant when found upon the
shore.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Ray.</i> This rough fishing life,&mdash;do you like it?</p>

<p><i>Sept.</i> Like it! to be sure I do; for I have known no
other. I was lulled to sleep in infancy by the dash of the
waves upon the rocks, the whistling of the breeze among
the shingles of the old house; and, winter and summer,
I have been rocked upon the bosom of the only mother
I know,&mdash;the ocean.</p>

<p><i>Ray.</i> Oh! but there’s danger in it.</p>

<p><i>Sept.</i> Yes, there is danger; but who, with a true
heart and a stout arm, cares for danger! Ah, that’s the
sport of it! To be upon the sea when the winds are
roaring, and the waves are seething in anger; to hear
along shore the dash of the sea upon the rocks, and to
know you have a stout plank beneath you and a light
bark obedient to your command, braving the fury of
the tempest,&mdash;ah, that’s glorious!</p>

<p><i>Ray.</i> But it is mere drudgery. You have read some,
I know. Have you never longed for other scenes,&mdash;other
occupations?</p>

<p><i>Sept.</i> To be sure I have. As I have read of great
generals and their campaigns, of merchant princes,&mdash;their
thrift and industry,&mdash;I have longed to be among
them, to bear a hand in the battle, to test my brain, or
strain my sinews with the best.</p>

<p><i>Ray.</i> Well, why have you never tried? The city is
open to all who possess industry and talent.</p>

<p><i>Sept.</i> Ay, ay, sir. But here’s father and mother
Gale; age is creeping upon them: who is to take care
of them? No, no! let the dream pass. They might
have left me to die upon the sands: but they took me to
their hearts; and, with Heaven’s help, I’ll be a true son
to them in their old age. (<i>Enter <span class="smcap">March</span>, <span class="smcapuc">L.</span></i>)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>

<p><i>March.</i> (<i>Aside.</i>) Halloo! what’s going on here!
Something about me.</p>

<p><i>Ray.</i> March,&mdash;is he contented here?</p>

<p><i>March.</i> (<i>Aside.</i>) Not by a long chalk.</p>

<p><i>Sept.</i> March? Oh! he’s a queer fish; his head is
filled with whimsical notions regarding his parentage.</p>

<p><i>Ray.</i> Has he any clue to his parents?</p>

<p><i>Sept.</i> No more than I have.</p>

<p><i>March.</i> (<i>Aside.</i>) Don’t be too sure of that.</p>

<p><i>Ray.</i> Has he any recollection of a mother?</p>

<p><i>March.</i> (<i>Breaking in.</i>) Most certainly he has.</p>

<p><i>Ray.</i> How?</p>

<p><i>March.</i> That is, I think I must have had one; and
my father,&mdash;I know where he is, and just what he looks
like.</p>

<p><i>Ray.</i> You do!</p>

<p><i>March.</i> Yes: he’s rather tall, gray hair, dresses well,
and looks like me.</p>

<p><i>Ray.</i> (<i>Laughing.</i>) A very accurate description.</p>

<p><i>March.</i> You know him, then?</p>

<p><i>Ray.</i> Me! how should I?</p>

<p><i>March.</i> He’s rich too.</p>

<p><i>Ray.</i> Ah! that’s good.</p>

<p><i>March.</i> Yes; and he’s got his eye on me. He’s looking
after me. He’s only waiting to see how I take it.
He fears it will overcome me: but when he finds I am
instinctively drawn towards him; when he finds I only
wait to hear a voice say&mdash; (<i>Enter <span class="smcap">Kitty</span>, <span class="smcapuc">L.</span></i>)</p>

<p><i>Kitty.</i> March, I’ve peeled the taters.</p>

<p><i>March.</i> Confound your taters!</p>

<p><i>Ray.</i> Well, well, March, remember the old adage,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
“Patient waiting, no loss.” Come, Sept., let’s go down
and look at the captain’s boat. (<i>Exit with <span class="smcap">Sept.</span>, <span class="smcapuc">C.</span></i>)</p>

<p><i>March.</i> Kitty Gale, you’re enough to try the patience
of Job: just when I was on the brink of a discovery, you
must pop in, and spoil every thing.</p>

<p><i>Kitty.</i> How could I help it? I did’nt know you was
on the brink of any thing.</p>

<p><i>March.</i> In another moment, I should have found my
father.</p>

<p><i>Kitty.</i> Oh, pshaw! you’re always finding a father.
I don’t believe you ever had one.</p>

<p><i>March.</i> You don’t, hey? I have got one, and he’s
rich too; got a fine horse&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Kitty.</i> Then why don’t you find him? Bige Parker
don’t have to hunt for his father!</p>

<p><i>March.</i> Bige Parker! Do you dare to speak his
name to me?</p>

<p><i>Kitty.</i> To be sure I do. I’m going to walk with him
to-night: perhaps he’ll see more beautiful rainbows.</p>

<p><i>March.</i> We’ll see about that. I’ll just go and hunt
him up, and he’ll ketch the darndest licking ever he got:
you see if he don’t. (<i>Dashes out, <span class="smcapuc">C.</span></i>)</p>

<p><i>Kitty.</i> Now he’s gone off mad. Well, I don’t care.
(<i>Enter <span class="smcap">Mrs. Gale</span>, <span class="smcapuc">L.</span></i>)</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Gale.</i> Come, Kitty, hurry and set the table
(<i>pulls table out, <span class="smcapuc">C.</span>, spreads it; she and <span class="smcap">Kitty</span> get cloth and
dishes, and lay the table, during the scene</i>).</p>

<p><i>Kitty.</i> Lord! here comes the captain back again.
(<i>Enter <span class="smcap">Capt.</span> and <span class="smcap">Kate</span>, <span class="smcapuc">C.</span></i>)</p>

<p><i>Kate.</i> It’s no use, Captain; my answer is still the
same: I can never marry you.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Capt.</i> Now, that’s deused unpleasant, after a fellah
has come down here in his <em>wacht</em>.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Gale</i> (<i>to Kitty</i>). What’s he say? he’s got warts!
I’ll cure ’em for him.</p>

<p><i>Kitty.</i> Hush, mother! he’s making love to Miss Kate.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Gale.</i> Land sakes! he don’t look strong enough
to make love to a skeeter.</p>

<p><i>Capt.</i> Do let me entreat you to reverse your decision.</p>

<p><i>Kate.</i> Not another word, Captain. (<i>Enter <span class="smcap">John
Gale</span>, <span class="smcapuc">L.</span></i>) Ah! here’s Mr. Gale. Mr. Gale, let me make
you acquainted with a friend of mine, Capt. Dandelion.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Gale</i> (<i>seizing Captain by hand, giving him a
rough shake</i>). Glad to see you, Captain. I’ve been admiring
your yacht. She’s a beauty.</p>

<p><i>Capt.</i> (<i>shaking his own hand</i>). Another fisherman.
More lobsters’ claws. (<i>Enter <span class="smcap">Raymond</span>, <span class="smcapuc">R.</span></i>)</p>

<p><i>Ray.</i> John Gale, I forgot one question about the
wrecks. Did you find no name about them?</p>

<p><i>John Gale.</i> Name? yes. We found the name of one
on pieces of the wreck. ’Twas the Gladiator. The
name of the other, on a bucket,&mdash;this one (<i>takes up bucket,
<span class="smcapuc">L.</span>, turns it round, showing the name Diana nearly effaced</i>),
the Diana.</p>

<p><i>Ray.</i> The Diana? Merciful Heaven! which one
was this?</p>

<p><i>John Gale.</i> The first. The one which gave us our
Sept.</p>

<p><i>Ray.</i> Sept.?</p>

<p><i>John Gale.</i> You seem mighty interested in these
wrecks.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Ray.</i> I am, I am, John Gale. My wife and her
infant son sailed from Havre in that same Diana, twenty-three
years ago. She was the only passenger with a
child: of that I have had abundant proof. This wreck,
this name (<i>Enter <span class="smcap">Sept.</span>, <span class="smcapuc">C.</span></i>), the story of the wreck, are
convincing proofs of the presence of my lost child beneath
your roof. He can be no other than September
Gale.</p>

<p><i>Sept.</i> Me? I your son?</p>

<p><i>Ray.</i> Yes, my boy: you are indeed my son. You see
now, Kate, why your marriage with him was impossible.
He is your brother.</p>

<p><i>Kate.</i> My brother? oh, misery!</p>

<p><i>Sept.</i> Her brother? thus ends my dream of happiness.</p>

<p><i>Capt.</i> Her brother? ’Pon honor, my chance is wealy
better.</p>

<p><i>John Gale.</i> Well, this does beat all natur.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Gale.</i> Sept.! Sept.! My dear boy, I can’t lose
you.</p>

<p><i>March.</i> (<i>outside, <span class="smcapuc">C.</span></i>). Darn you, Bige Parker! You
just come out here in this public highway. (<i>Enter <span class="smcapuc">C.</span>,
with a black eye and nose bloody.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Kitty.</i> Why, March Gale! what have you been doing?
Fighting Bige Parker?</p>

<p><i>March.</i> Yes, rather.</p>

<p><i>Kitty.</i> Did you thrash him?</p>

<p><i>March.</i> Does this look like it? (<i>Points to eye.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Kitty.</i> O March! there’s been such a time here!
Mr. Raymond lost a son twenty-three years ago.</p>

<p><i>March.</i> Yes.</p>

<p><i>Kitty.</i> And what do you think?&mdash;he’s just discovered
him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>

<p><i>March.</i> I told you so,&mdash;I told you so! It’s coming.</p>

<p><i>Kitty.</i> He’s discovered him here.</p>

<p><i>March.</i> Yes, yes.</p>

<p><i>Kitty.</i> And who do you suppose it is?</p>

<p><i>March.</i> Suppose? I know, Kitty. Can I smother
the paternal instinct in my bosom? It is&mdash;it is&mdash;</p>

<p><i>March.</i> Now, isn’t this a nice little family party?
Since Sept. found his father, the house has been about as
lively as a funeral. Daddy Gale is as cross as Julius
Cæsar, and Mother Gale as dumb as an oyster. Sept.
doesn’t seem to take kindly to his new position; and Miss
Kate acts as though she had lost a mother, instead of
finding a brother. Nobody seems to have any life, except
Kitty; and she’s busy flirting with that Capt. Dandelion&mdash;confound
him. I say, Mother Gale?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Gale.</i> Well?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>

<p><i>March.</i> Where’s Sept.?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Gale.</i> Don’no, and don’t care.</p>

<p><i>March.</i> Daddy Gale?</p>

<p><i>John.</i> Well?</p>

<p><i>March.</i> Where’s Sept.?</p>

<p><i>John.</i> Don’no, and don’t care?</p>

<p><i>March.</i> Dry weather, ain’t it?</p>

<p><i>John</i> (<i>fiercely</i>). Now, what’s the use of talking about
the weather?</p>

<p><i>March.</i> So I say: what’s the use of talking at all? I
like singing better (<i>sings</i>),&mdash;</p>

<p><i>March.</i> (<i>Aside.</i>) I thought that would fetch them.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Gale.</i> If John Gale was any kind of a man,
he’d soon put an end to sich nonsense.</p>

<p><i>John.</i> Now, what’s the use of telling about John
Gale? You spilt the boys! you know you did.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Gale.</i> Gracious goodness! the man is crazy:
I spiled ’em?</p>

<p><i>John.</i> Yes, you.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Gale.</i> John Gale, you’re a brute.</p>

<p><i>John.</i> You’re another.</p>

<p><i>March.</i> (<i>Aside.</i>) Hallo! it’s getting squally here.</p>

<p><i>John.</i> Here I find these ’ere lads left to die on the
shore: and, in the goodness of my heart, I brings ’em
home, and tries to make good, honest men on ’em; but
what have you done? You’ve made one a fine gentleman,
that don’t know us; and the other a sassy chap,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
that’s eternally squalling when we want peace and
quiet.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Gale.</i> Well, I never, John Gale! if I had a
skillet, I’d comb your hair for you, you brute. (<i>Enter
<span class="smcap">Sept.</span>, <span class="smcapuc">C.</span></i>)</p>

<p><i>Sept.</i> Hallo! hallo! what’s the matter now? Silent!
no word of welcome for me! Well, well, what’s gone
wrong, father? what’s gone wrong?</p>

<p><i>John Gale.</i> Now, what’s the use of calling me <em>father</em>?
I ain’t yer father. You’ve got a rich father, rolling in
riches; and you’re a great man now. Of course you look
down on us poor fishing-folks: it’s what we expected.</p>

<p><i>Sept.</i> Indeed!</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Gale.</i> Yes: poor folks must remember their
station now.</p>

<p><i>Sept.</i> Ay, mother, that they must. If they are
honest and true, loving God and their fellow-men,
their station is the proudest and the noblest among mankind:
for the hands they raise to heaven bear the
proof-marks of their kinship to Nature’s first nobleman,
Father Adam; and their hearts are rolls of honor, ever
brightened by inscriptions of good works and noble
heroism.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Gale.</i> Heavens and airth! do hear that boy
talk!</p>

<p><i>Sept.</i> Pray heaven, I may never forget mine,&mdash;never
forget the kind benefactors who in my helplessness rescued
me from the fury of the storm, who took me to
their hearts, watched over me in sickness, guided my
feet in the path of duty, and made a man of me. It
may be as you say,&mdash;that I have found a father, one who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
claims me by right of birth; but my heart beats with no
such feeling of love, of reverence, and of duty, towards
him, as it does for the honest, true-hearted old fisherman,
John Gale (<i>takes <span class="smcap">John Gale’s</span> hand</i>).</p>

<p><i>John.</i> God bless you, Sept.! God bless you, boy!
I knew you were true as steel; but the old lady&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Gale.</i> Now, stop, John Gale! don’t you go to
slandering.</p>

<p><i>Sept.</i> And a mother! where shall I find her? They
tell me, that, long ago, she found a grave beneath the
wave; but my heart tells me she is here,&mdash;here, where
my childhood was passed; here among the rocks and
sands, where the wild winds roar their loudest and the
dark waves beat their fiercest. At the feet of her who
first taught me the name of mother, I lay a son’s love
and duty, which she, and she alone, has right to claim
(<i>kneels at <span class="smcap">Mrs. Gale’s</span> feet</i>).</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Gale.</i> O Sept., Sept.! my dear, dear, boy:
we thought we were going to lose you now you are rich
and high in the world.</p>

<p><i>Sept.</i> Never fear, mother, never fear. Come what
will, this is my home. We have weathered it together
when the clouds of adversity gathered thick about, and we’ll
share together the sunshine of prosperity which now
breaks upon us.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Gale.</i> Dear me, dear me! what does ail my
glasses? I can’t see. There, I’ve dropped another stitch;
and good gracious! where’s my handkercher? I declare,
I’ve dropped it somewhere&mdash;I never did see such careless&mdash; (<i>Exit, <span class="smcapuc">L.</span></i>)</p>

<p><i>John Gale.</i> Hang me if I don’t believe something,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
run into my pipe, and put it out. Well, Sept., here’s my
hand: you’re an honor to us, and all you’ve got is rightly
yours; you deserve it. Come, March, let’s go down and
look arter the boats. (<i>Exit, <span class="smcapuc">C.</span> <span class="smcap">March</span> has been sitting
staring at <span class="smcap">Sept.</span> with mouth open.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Sept.</i> Hallo, March, who are you staring at?</p>

<p><i>March.</i> At a chap that’s got a father. It’s a wonderful
curiosity to me. I say, Sept., how does it feel?</p>

<p><i>Sept.</i> Well, March, thus far I can’t say I like it.</p>

<p><i>March.</i> Don’t like it? what a queer chap you are! I
wish I was in your shoes.</p>

<p><i>Sept.</i> I wish with all my heart you were.</p>

<p><i>March.</i> A rich father and a beautiful sister!</p>

<p><i>Sept.</i> Sister! Ah, there’s the sting!</p>

<p><i>March.</i> Why, you don’t mean to say&mdash;oh? good gracious!
why, you were dead in love with her&mdash;you can’t
marry her now, you know.</p>

<p><i>Sept.</i> No: all my fond dreams of happiness are dispelled
by this unfortunate affair.</p>

<p><i>March.</i> Unfortunate! well, you are a queer one.
Don’t I wish it was me? wouldn’t I make the money
fly?</p>

<p><i>John Gale</i> (<i>outside, <span class="smcapuc">C.</span></i>). March, March, must I wait
all day for you, hay?</p>

<p><i>March.</i> Hallo! I forgot I had a job on hand. Good-by
Sept.,&mdash;poor unfortunate son of a millionnaire.
(<i>Exit, <span class="smcapuc">C.</span></i>)</p>

<p><i>Sept.</i> Sister! can I ever call her by that name; must
I forever relinquish the hope of claiming her by a dearer
title. No, no: I bear to her something warmer than a
brother’s love. This cannot be: this man Raymond<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
treated with scorn my overtures for the hand of his
daughter. He can have no proof that I am his son,&mdash;nothing
but the fact that his infant child was a passenger
in the vessel that left me on the sands. He cannot claim
me upon such a mere thread as this. Perhaps it is a plot
to keep me quiet until his daughter is married to some
wealthy suitor; and then how easy to discover his mistake,
and cast me adrift in the world. Ah! here is Kate.
(<i><span class="smcap">Kate</span>, <span class="smcapuc">R.</span></i>) Good-morning, sister.</p>

<p><i>Kate.</i> Sister?</p>

<p><i>Sept.</i> It sounds strange from my lips, does it not?</p>

<p><i>Kate.</i> Indeed, it does, Sept.: you know I have never
been called so before; and&mdash;and&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Sept.</i> You expected once that I should use a dearer
title.</p>

<p><i>Kate.</i> Once&mdash;O Sept., Sept.! this is so strange.
We were so happy yesterday, it seems like awakening
from a glorious dream. That you should be fated to
call me by the name of sister&mdash;it is cruel. I awoke
last night, and saw the moonbeams stream in at my
window. I arose, and looked out upon the night! the
waters were calm and peaceful; the moon glistened upon
the rocks, lighting the very spot where you and I sat
last night, telling our future hopes. I know it was wicked;
but I was so wretched, so miserable, I wished I was
sleeping calm and still beneath the waves from which you
rescued me, ere I had awakened to such misery as this.</p>

<p><i>Sept.</i> Be calm, dear Kate: all will yet be well; I
am not your brother.</p>

<p><i>Kate.</i> Not my brother! you jest now. My father has
claimed you.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Sept.</i> But there is something here that revolts at the
kinship. Why should he claim me as his son? There
are no proofs, no likeness to him, or her he calls my
mother. Nothing but the mere fact that I was found
after the wreck of the vessel in which his wife sailed.</p>

<p><i>Kate.</i> No, no! Sept., he must be right. He does see
a resemblance to his lost wife in your face. No, no! it
must be true.</p>

<p><i>Sept.</i> I will not believe it without further proof. I do
not feel towards him as I know I should were he my
father; and as for a brother’s love, the love within my
heart for you is of a higher and a holier nature than
even that of brother. Kate, you told me last night that
you loved me, that you would one day be my wife:
will you still keep your promise?</p>

<p><i>Kate.</i> O Sept.! it is impossible!</p>

<p><i>Sept.</i> If this should be a trick,&mdash;a trick to rob me of
you,&mdash;this claim put forward to keep me from your path
until you had wed a richer suitor&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Kate.</i> Why, Sept., you cannot believe my father so base
as that: you are mad?</p>

<p><i>Sept.</i> Yes, Kate! I am mad,&mdash;madly in love with you.
Believe me, I am not your brother. This is, at the best,
a mere suspicion.</p>

<p><i>Kate.</i> Suspicion! yes: it is a suspicion, but one that
must forever separate us. It may be you are right, and
something at my heart tells me you are; but this suspicion
will forever darken my life. No, Sept.; much as I love
you, it were better we should forever dismiss the hope.
For, whether further proof should be found or not, every
hope of happiness would be blasted by the fear&mdash;the dread&mdash;that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
you might be my brother. Sept., you shall
always find in me a sister, a loving sister; ever watchful
for your comfort, ever praying for your happiness; but,
for Heaven’s sake, no more of a warmer tie. (<i>Exit, <span class="smcapuc">R.</span></i>)</p>

<p><i>Sept.</i> Have I lost her? What can I do? where turn
to escape from this bewildering maze? Upon this I am
determined: I will not accept this man’s bounty, or
acknowledge his claim. (<i>Enter <span class="smcap">Raymond</span>, <span class="smcapuc">C.</span></i>)</p>

<p><i>Mr. R.</i> My dear boy, I’ve just despatched a messenger
to town with the glad tidings; and to-morrow
we’ll leave this barren spot, and hie to the gay scenes of
city-life. Gad! boy, we’ll make a gentleman of you.
You must drop that outlandish name of September: you
shall be Alden Raymond, jr.</p>

<p><i>Sept.</i> You go to town?</p>

<p><i>Ray.</i> Yes, to-morrow: I’m impatient to show my
city friends the fine lad I found down by the sea.</p>

<p><i>Sept.</i> I cannot share your gratification, sir, for I shall
remain here.</p>

<p><i>Ray.</i> Remain here! what for?</p>

<p><i>Sept.</i> Because I belong here. Mr. Raymond, I am
extremely obliged to you for the kind interest you have
manifested in me; but I cannot accept your claim. I do
not believe I am your son.</p>

<p><i>Ray.</i> Not my son! why, boy, you are crazy. There
cannot be the least doubt of it: you came in the vessel
with my wife; there was no other infant on board.</p>

<p><i>Sept.</i> That you are not certain of.</p>

<p><i>Ray.</i> Certain! of course I am. I tell you, boy, there
can be no mistake.</p>

<p><i>Sept.</i> There may be; there must be. I do not feel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
towards you the love of a son for his father; and, until
some other proof is found, I shall remain here, and bear
the only name to which I feel I have a right,&mdash;that of
September Gale. (<i>Exit, <span class="smcapuc">L.</span></i>)</p>

<p><i>Ray.</i> But, boy&mdash;Sept., come here. Confound him!
Here’s a pretty predicament. Here’s an ungrateful scamp
who refuses to acknowledge his father. I’ll disinherit
him&mdash;oh, pshaw! what does he care for that? He’s a
noble fellow, and he must be my son. (<i>Exit, <span class="smcapuc">R.</span> Enter <span class="smcap">Captain</span>,
<span class="smcapuc">C.</span>, with <span class="smcap">Kitty</span> on his arm.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Kitty.</i> Well, I declare, Captain, you are the most delightfulest
beau that ever I saw.</p>

<p><i>Capt.</i> No, wealy: ’pon honor, you overwhelm me;
you do, wealy, you dear, delightful little nymph of the sea.</p>

<p><i>Kitty.</i> You’re the sweetest man: your conversation
is so sugary.</p>

<p><i>Capt.</i> Yes, jest so: ’pon my honor, I don’t know the
weason, but the ladies in the city are very fond of me.
I am quite a flower in the city.</p>

<p><i>Kitty.</i> (<i>Aside.</i>) A sunflower! Oh, I do wish that
March could see us!</p>

<p><i>Capt.</i> Yaas, you should go to the city; such a beautiful
cweature is wasting her sweetness on the desert air
in this howid place, that smells so of fish.</p>

<p><i>Kitty.</i> Now, do you think so, Captain? Well, I’ve
always thought I was born for a higher sphere.</p>

<p><i>Capt.</i> You were, weally. Your beauty would be the
admiration of the whole city: it would, weally.</p>

<p><i>Kitty.</i> O Captain! you flatter now.</p>

<p><i>Capt.</i> Flatter? ’pon honor, no. Do let me take you
to the city in my <em>wacht</em>: the trip would be delightful.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Kitty.</i> What! (<i>Aside.</i>) I do believe the man wants
me to run away with him. (<i>Enter March, <span class="smcapuc">C.</span></i>)</p>

<p><i>Capt.</i> Yaas, we could slip away from here, go to
the city, see all the sights, and return, without any of
these people being the wiser.</p>

<p><i>March.</i> (<i>Aside.</i>) Confound his picture! he’s trying
to run off with Kitty.</p>

<p><i>Kitty.</i> Why, what an idea! I run off with a man!&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Capt.</i> Who loves you to distraction; he does, weally.</p>

<p><i>Kitty.</i> What would Miss Kate say?</p>

<p><i>Capt.</i> Who cares what she says? ’Tis you I love,
you whom I adore.</p>

<p><i>Kitty.</i> Why, what would March say?</p>

<p><i>March.</i> (<i>Coming between them.</i>) He’ll be cursed if
you do any thing of the kind.</p>

<p><i>Kitty.</i> March! you here?</p>

<p><i>Capt.</i> That howid fisherman!</p>

<p><i>March.</i> Yes, that howid fisherman, you confounded
old goggle-eyed sculpin! And as for you, Kitty Sands,
I’m ashamed of you. A pretty pair you are! Want
to run off, do you?</p>

<p><i>Capt.</i> Come, come, sir! you’re impertinent.</p>

<p><i>March.</i> Oh! I’m impertinent, am I? Wall, I ain’t
near-sighted, and I don’t wear eye-glasses, and I can see
your nose plainly. (<i>Takes off his coat, and rolls up his
sleeves.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Kitty.</i> Why, March! what are you doing?</p>

<p><i>March.</i> I’m just going to open your nose in the most
approved style of the manly art! (<i>Squares off.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Capt.</i> Lord, gwacious! I believe the fellah’s going to
fight!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Kitty.</i> March, if you touch him, I’ll call father just
as loud as ever I can.</p>

<p><i>March.</i> Well, you call: you’ll get a pretty talking
to, I tell you. (<i>Advances to Capt.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Capt.</i> Here, you stop, you fellah! Stop, I say! (<i>Retreating
towards door, <span class="smcapuc">C.</span></i>)</p>

<p><i>March.</i> I’ll teach you to skulk round here with your

<p><i>Kitty.</i> Father, father! quick, quick!</p>

<p><i>Capt.</i> That’s right: call your father, or I’m a dead

Bige Parker, and going to fight the Captain,
because I encourage their attentions, and can’t see that
it’s all to make him speak. So jealous of everybody!
If he loves me, why don’t he tell me so? (<i>Enter Capt.,

in store for him, this is his home.</p>

<p><i>Ray.</i> I begin to like this place. We’ll set the men at
work, and put up a house on the bluffs, large and roomy.</p>

<p><i>John Gale.</i> That’s right; for this union of the Gales
will be likely to end in a squall.</p>

<p><i>Ray.</i> It shall be a family house, with room enough
for Sept. and his wife, March and his wife, John Gale

thanksgiving for the treasures found down by the

<p class="scene"><span class="smcap">Scene.</span>&mdash;<i>Tonsor’s barbershop. Two barber’s chairs,
<span class="smcapuc">C.</span>, facing audience. Table, <span class="smcapuc">L.</span>, with two hand-mirrors
upon it. Table, <span class="smcapuc">R.</span>, with razors, strop, shaving-cups, towels,
&amp;c. <span class="smcap">McGinnis</span> discovered dusting.</i></p>

<p><i>McGinnis.</i> Now, isn’t this illigant! It’s a moighty foine
lift I have in the worrld, onyhow. Mike McGinnis,
who’s curried the horse and fed the pig, toted the hod
and tinded the cows, promoted to the illigant position
of a man-shaver! Oh! be jabbers, it’s moighty foine intirely,&mdash;what
much I know ov it, and that’s moighty
little. Faith, when Mr. Tonsor’s assistant was took
wid the faver, it was at his wit’s ends he was intirely.
Sez he to me, sez he,&mdash;for it’s always moighty
fond he was of me whin I lived wid his father,&mdash;“Mike,”
sez he, “did iver yer shave?”&mdash;“Is it meself?”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
says I: “faith, yes,&mdash;wid a pair of scissors.”
“No, no!” sez he: “did ever yer shave anybody?”
“Faith, yes,” sez I&mdash;“the pig.”&mdash;“Oh, murther!” says
he: “I mane a man.”&mdash;“Niver a wun,” sez I; “but I
could soon learn.” And so he took me in here to learn
the business; but it’s precious little I’m learning, for the
mashter does all the shaving: but the time must come,
and then look out for yoursilf, Mike McGinnis. (<i>Enter
Tonsor, <span class="smcapuc">R.</span></i>)</p>

<p><i>Ton.</i> Ah, Mike! Brushing up? That’s good. I do
like to see a busy man. Where’s Zeb?</p>

<p><i>Mike.</i> Faith, I don’t know. It’s moighty little he’s
shown of his face at all, at all.</p>

<p><i>Ton.</i> The lazy scamp! that’s just like him. No doubt
he’s down at the Corners dancing jigs, or turning flip-flaps
for coppers.</p>

<p><i>Mike.</i> Faix, that’s what yer might call turning an
honest penny!</p>

<p><i>Ton.</i> Any customers this morning, Mike?</p>

<p><i>Mike.</i> Sorra a wun.</p>

<p><i>Ton.</i> It’s a little early. They’ll soon be dropping
in. Heigho, Mike! was you ever in love?</p>

<p><i>Mike.</i> Ah! away wid yer, now! Ask an Irishman
such a silly question as that! Musha, it’s nearly kilt
I am wid the love of Nora Honey. Ah! but the ould
man’s got rich <em>peddling panuts</em>.</p>

<p><i>Ton.</i> A rich father, who does not encourage your
attentions!</p>

<p><i>Mike.</i> Sorra a bit. “Mike,” sez he,&mdash;and it’s moighty
winning he is in his way,&mdash;“the front uv my door is illigantly
painted on the outside,&mdash;much finer than the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
inside; and you’d do well to examine it whin you’re
passing by,&mdash;whin you’re passing by, mind.”</p>

<p><i>Ton.</i> Meaning, “I won’t turn you out, but you can’t
stay here.”</p>

<p><i>Mike.</i> That’s jest what he meant. Faith, it’s well
posted yez are in the trials and tribulations uv the tinder
passion.</p>

<p><i>Ton.</i> Yes, Mike; I can sympathize with you. I’m
desperately in love myself.</p>

<p><i>Mike.</i> You?</p>

<p><i>Ton.</i> Yes, and with the daughter of a rich man, and
my love is returned. Ah, Mike! she is the paragon of
loveliness!&mdash;the otto of roses!&mdash;the pink of purity.</p>

<p><i>Mike.</i> The shaving-cream uv perfiction, and the hair-oil
uv illigance! Oh, murther! they’re all alike till
they find you’ve no money.</p>

<p><i>Ton.</i> Ah! but she’s entirely different, Mike. She is
willing&mdash;nay, anxious&mdash;to share my humble fortunes.
’Tis I who dread to take her from all the rich comforts
she has enjoyed, and ask her to share&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Mike.</i> Love in a cottage, wid bacon and greens!
Faith, you’re right: it’s a mighty foine picter, but hard
of digestion. What says the ould gintleman?</p>

<p><i>Ton.</i> He knows nothing about it.</p>

<p><i>Mike.</i> And yer haven’t asked his consint?</p>

<p><i>Ton.</i> No: it would be useless. He has declared his
daughter shall marry only a rich man; that he will not
let her walk, ride, or receive the visits of any young
man; that he will cut her off with a shilling should she
marry <em>without his consent</em>.</p>

<p><i>Mike.</i> The taring ould heathin!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Ton.</i> He is encouraging the attentions of young Simper,
whom the young lady detests, and whom he only
tolerates because he has a rich father.</p>

<p><i>Mike.</i> The miserable ould varmint! But who is
he?</p>

<p><i>Ton.</i> One of my customers,&mdash;old Jotham Crusty.</p>

<p><i>Mike.</i> What! that ould skinflint? His consint? It’s
precious little he’d give onyhow.</p>

<p><i>Zeb.</i> (<i>Outside, <span class="smcapuc">R.</span></i>) Ain’t yer ’shamed yerself, yer
great, overgrown? Fie!&mdash;for shame! Yer ought to be
redicleish!</p>

<p><i>Ton.</i> Hallo! here’s Zeb. What’s the matter now?
(<i>Enter <span class="smcap">Zeb</span>, <span class="smcapuc">R.</span>, shaking his head and fighting imaginary
foes outside.</i>) Where have you been? and what is the
matter?</p>

<p><i>Zeb.</i> Yes, well, I guess&mdash;Who-o-o-’s a nigger?
Who&mdash;who’s a nigger? Dar ain’t no niggers now:
didn’t de prancepation krocklemation make ’em white
folks, hey?</p>

<p><i>Ton.</i> Here, what’s the matter?</p>

<p><i>Zeb.</i> Yes, well, I guess&mdash;a parcel of ignumramuses
a-yellin’ and a-shoutin’ as ef dey nebber seed a tanned
man afore. What does de Declamation of Indempendence
say,&mdash;hey?</p>

<p><i>Ton.</i> No matter what it says. You just take off your
jacket and go to work, or you’ll find out what a tanned
man is. (<i><span class="smcap">Zeb</span> takes off his jacket, <span class="smcapuc">R.</span></i>)</p>

<p><i>Mike.</i> Faith, Zeb, it’s plaguing uv yez the b’ys
have been.</p>

<p><i>Zeb.</i> Yes, well I guess&mdash;Who’s a nigger? what
does the Constitution say,&mdash;hey?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Ton.</i> Look here, Zeb! if you open your mouth
again, it won’t be healthy for your constitution.</p>

<p><i>Zeb.</i> Yes, well, I guess!&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Ton.</i> Shut up quick, and hone those razors! (<i><span class="smcap">Zeb</span> goes
to table, <span class="smcapuc">R.</span></i>) We’ve had just enough of your talk.
(<i>Enter <span class="smcap">Crusty</span>, <span class="smcapuc">R.</span></i>)</p>

<p><i>Crusty.</i> Oh! you’re here, are you? Pretty time this is
to get your place open,&mdash;ain’t it? You forget it’s the
early bird that catches the worm.</p>

<p><i>Zeb.</i> Worms? worms? Going a-fishing, Massa
Crusty.</p>

<p><i>Ton.</i> You Zeb!&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Zeb.</i> By golly, I know where ’em are!&mdash;flounders as
big as a slab; and eels, golly,&mdash;what whoppers!</p>

<p><i>Ton.</i> Shut up, and mind your business! Yes, Mr.
Crusty; first chance for you this morning.</p>

<p><i>Crusty.</i> Yes, I should think so! I tell you what,
Tonsor, you don’t go to work right to make a fortune.
Do as I did,&mdash;early to bed, and early up in the morning.
You live too fast: you should sober down. Why don’t
you get married?</p>

<p><i>Ton.</i> Ah, Mr. Crusty, that’s the very thing I would
like to do. A nice little wife, a nice home, every thing
comfortable,&mdash;ah, sir! a man must be happy.</p>

<p><i>Crusty.</i> Of course he must, and make money too.
Why don’t you try it? There’s plenty of girls about here
anxious to get a husband.</p>

<p><i>Ton.</i> I know that, sir; but I’ve already made my
choice.</p>

<p><i>Crusty.</i> Oh! you have? Then why don’t you get married,
have a little comfort, and not poke along in this way,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
with no company but a thick-headed Irishman and a
ball of blacking?</p>

<p><i>Mike.</i> Faith, it’s mighty complimentary is the ould
gint, onyhow.</p>

<p><i>Zeb.</i> Yes, well I guess! Ball of blacking,&mdash;blacking!
What does the Declamation&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Ton.</i> Shut up, Zeb!</p>

<p><i>Crusty.</i> Say, Tonsor, why don’t you get married?</p>

<p><i>Ton.</i> Well, sir, you see, sir&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Crusty.</i> Oh, bother! why don’t you speak out?</p>

<p><i>Mike.</i> Faith, Mr. Crusty, I’ll be afther telling uv
yez: it’s mighty bashful is the masther. Ye say, sir,
it’s all along uv the young lady’s father.</p>

<p><i>Crusty.</i> Well, what of him?</p>

<p><i>Mike.</i> Ye say, sir, he’s wealthy and concaited, and
manes the daughter shall niver marry anybody but a
rich man.</p>

<p><i>Crusty.</i> Not when such a likely young man as Tonsor
offers? The mean old scamp!</p>

<p><i>Mike.</i> That’s thrue for yez, sir. He won’t let her go
wid a young man, or have a young man come uv courtin’
her.</p>

<p><i>Crusty.</i> The miserable old scoundrel!</p>

<p><i>Mike.</i> And swears by all that’s blue that he’ll cut her
off widout a shilling if she marries widout his consent.</p>

<p><i>Crusty.</i> The miserly old vagabond! Look here, Tonsor,
you must marry this girl directly.</p>

<p><i>Ton.</i> Marry her!</p>

<p><i>Crusty.</i> Marry her?&mdash;yes! Confound you! don’t
you want to?</p>

<p><i>Ton.</i> But her father&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Crusty.</i> Who cares for him? The mean old scamp!
I’d like to play him a trick, and I will too. Here, you
just take my chaise,&mdash;it’s at the door,&mdash;get the young
lady, go down to Hobson, get a license, and then be off
to Parson Sanborn, and get married at once.</p>

<p><i>Ton.</i> But, Mr. Crusty, her father will not consent
to this.</p>

<p><i>Crusty.</i> Confound her father! Who cares for him or
his consent? I give mine, and that is enough. I’m the
richest man in the place; and, if anybody complains, let
’em sue me for damages. I won’t have such a confounded
mean old cuss&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Ton.</i> Take care, Mr. Crusty!</p>

<p><i>Crusty.</i> &mdash;tomer in town!</p>

<p><i>Ton.</i> You will back me in this?</p>

<p><i>Crusty.</i> Back you?&mdash;of course I will! Do you suppose
I’ll stand by and see youth and honesty and worth
given the go-by, by an old, mean&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Ton.</i> Don’t, Mr. Crusty,&mdash;don’t call him names.</p>

<p><i>Crusty.</i> Here, I’ll give you a note to Parson Sanborn,
and another for old Hobson. They’ll help you along.
I’ll tell the parson to tie the knot strong. (<i>Goes to table,
<span class="smcapuc">R.</span></i>) A mean, contemptible scamp!</p>

<p><i>Zeb.</i> By golly, the old man’s crazy sure for sartain!
See him eyes roll!</p>

<p><i>Ton.</i> Mike, I’ve a great mind to take the old man at
his word.</p>

<p><i>Mike.</i> If yer don’t, yer a goose. He gives his consent,
and ye’ll have it in writin’, too. Go it, honey!</p>

<p><i>Crusty.</i> There you are: there’s a note for the parson,
and another for old Hobson. Give my regards to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
lady, and tell her she’s a goose if she misses such a
chance of getting a husband.</p>

<p><i>Ton.</i> Thank you, Mr. Crusty. I’ll be off at once.
Mike, you look after the shop. Don’t let old Crusty out
of here for half an hour, mind.</p>

<p><i>Crusty.</i> Come, come! I want that horse and chaise
in half an hour.</p>

<p><i>Ton.</i> All right, sir. I’ll be back before then.
Mike, give the old gentleman a shave. Good-by! I’m
off. (<i>Exit, <span class="smcapuc">R.</span></i>)</p>

<p><i>Mike.</i> Good luck to yez! Here’s an old shoe for
luck. (<i>Throws a shoe off, <span class="smcapuc">R.</span>, which hits <span class="smcap">Zeb</span> in head.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Zeb.</i> Stop, yer fool&mdash;will yer? By golly, you almos’
broke my jaw!</p>

<p><i>Mike.</i> Faith, if I had, ’twould been a savin’ for the
shop.</p>

<p><i>Crusty.</i> The young man’s off. Good joke on the girl’s
father! Well, it won’t cost me any thing; so I can afford
to give my consent. (<i>Takes off handkerchief and dicky.</i>)
Now, my man, I’ll trouble you for a shave.</p>

<p><i>Mike.</i> A shave! (<i>Aside.</i>) Oh, murther! how could
I go to work to shave this ould rhinoceros?</p>

<p><i>Crusty.</i> Come, be lively! I want to get out of this at
once. I’m wanted at the house.</p>

<p><i>Mike.</i> Oh, murther and Irish! at the house is it?
(<i>Aside.</i>) Faith, that’ll niver do. (<i>Aloud.</i>) Here, sit
down here, sir.</p>

<p><i>Crusty.</i> (<i>Sits in chair, <span class="smcapuc">R. C.</span></i>) A close shave, mind!</p>

<p><i>Mike.</i> A close shave is it? (<i>Aside.</i>) By the blissed
St. Patrick, what’s that? (<i>Enter <span class="smcap">Simper</span>, <span class="smcapuc">R.</span></i>)</p>

<p><i>Simper.</i> Now, weally, ’tis disgustingly vulgaw,&mdash;it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
weally,&mdash;the ideah of a wefined gentleman being compelled
to entaw such a howid place, to have his chin
shaved, and his whiskaws twimmed: it is weally!</p>

<p><i>Mike.</i> Your turn next, sir: take a seat.</p>

<p><i>Simper.</i> My turn next? Do you weally mean to say
that I must wait? Aw!</p>

<p><i>Mike.</i> Faith, honey, you must: there’s niver a wun
to shave you at all, at all!</p>

<p><i>Simper.</i> But I can’t wait,&mdash;I can’t weally. I have
a pwessing engagement. A dear, delightful cweecher is
fondly waiting my coming,&mdash;she is weally.</p>

<p><i>Crusty.</i> (<i>Aside.</i>) Then all I’ve got to say, she’s got
a job. Here, you slow coach! am I never to have a
shave?</p>

<p><i>Mike.</i> In a minit, sir: the wather’s could. (<i>Puts
wrappers, towel, &amp;c., round him.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Simper.</i> Yes, weally, you must attend to me. The
dear cweecher will die: I know she will.</p>

<p><i>Crusty.</i> Then let her die, or shave yourself!</p>

<p><i>Mike.</i> Faith, sir, I can’t help it. Oh, murther! that’s
Zeb. It’s high time he had his hand in. Here, Zeb!
shave that gintleman.</p>

<p><i>Zeb.</i> What dat you say, hey?</p>

<p><i>Mike.</i> Oh, bother! Shave that gintleman.</p>

<p><i>Zeb.</i> Shabe him,&mdash;shabe him? me shabe him? By
golly! in coose,&mdash;in coose! (<i>To <span class="smcap">Simper</span>.</i>) Dar’s de
cheer. Hist yerself,&mdash;hist yerself!</p>

<p><i>Simper.</i> Do what?</p>

<p><i>Zeb.</i> Hist yerself, honey! Discompose yerself in
dat are cheer.</p>

<p><i>Simper.</i> Now, weally, the ideah of placing myself in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
the hands of such a howible cweecher! It’s too bad,&mdash;it
is weally. (<i>Sits in chair, &amp;c. <span class="smcap">Zeb</span> puts wrapper and
towel about him.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Simper.</i> Now, Mr. Bawbaw.</p>

<p><i>Zeb.</i> Mr. Which?</p>

<p><i>Simper.</i> Use despatch.</p>

<p><i>Zeb.</i> Yes, well, I guess not; we use razors hea, we
do.</p>

<p><i>Crusty.</i> Come, come, hurry up.</p>

<p><i>Mike.</i> Yes, sir, intirely, sir. (<i>Lathers him. <span class="smcap">Zeb</span> lathers
<span class="smcap">Simper</span>, putting it plentifully in his mouth.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Simper.</i> Ph&mdash;ph&mdash;ph&mdash;! deuse take you; do you
want to choke me with your nasty soap?</p>

<p><i>Zeb.</i> Yes, well, I guess not. It’s jest as wholesome as
flap-jacks and sirup. (<i>To <span class="smcap">Mike</span>.</i>) I’ve got him lathered:
what will I do with him now?</p>

<p><i>Mike.</i> Do, you spalpeen?&mdash;do wid him as I do wid
de <em>other</em> chap. (<i>Takes the razor.</i>) Now for my first
attimpt at shaving. Blessed St. Patrick, befrind me, or
I be afthir cuttin’ his wizen.</p>

<p><i>Zeb.</i> (<i>Goes to table, taking razor.</i>) I’m to do as Mike
does: golly, I kin do dat jist. (<i>During the next speeches
he runs between the two chairs, watching <span class="smcap">Mike</span>, and shaving
<span class="smcap">Simper</span>.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Simper.</i> Now, bawbaw, do your neatest; for, in a
few minutes, I shall be at the feet of a divine cweecher.</p>

<p><i>Zeb.</i> Screecher! does she play on de banjo too.</p>

<p><i>Simper.</i> Be careful now, don’t destwoy the symmetwy
of my whiskaws.</p>

<p><i>Zeb.</i> (<i>aside</i>). Sim&mdash;sim&mdash;sim&mdash;what am dat?
By golly, Mike’s taking de whiskers off dat chap of
his’en.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Simper.</i> I say, bawbaw: in a few minutes I shall
thwow myself at the feet of this divine cweecher; and I
shall say&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Crusty.</i> Confound you, stupid, you’ve cut me&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Mike.</i> Oh, murder! it was the razor. Bedad, I wish
I was well out of this.</p>

<p><i>Simper.</i> Oh!&mdash;murder!&mdash;murder! you’ve cut me
hawwibly!</p>

<p><i>Zeb.</i> By golly, so I has. (<i>Aside.</i>) Must do jes as
Mike does.</p>

<p><i>Simper.</i> Be careful, bawbaw: don’t spoil my complexion;
for it would be hawwible to meet my chawmew,
the divine Kate Cwusty, with a howwid cut.</p>

<p><i>Crusty.</i> Kate! this must be Simper. (<i><span class="smcap">Crusty</span> and
<span class="smcap">Simper</span> having their heads back in the chairs are supposed
not to see each other.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Simper.</i> Yes, bawbaw, the rich Miss Kate Cwusty.
Her fathaw’s immensely wich,&mdash;a gay old boy, who likes
to save his money; but we’ll teach him better when we
are mawwied.</p>

<p><i>Crusty.</i> (<i>Aside.</i>) Will you? confound you! we’ll
see about that.</p>

<p><i>Simper.</i> Bawbaw, be a little more gentle, if you
please; handle my ambwosials very carefully.</p>

<p><i>Zeb.</i> Ambrose who? Ambrose! by golly, I used
to know an Ambrose down Souf,&mdash;a molasses-darkey,
about your complex&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Simper.</i> Why, you, bawbaw, do you mean to compare
me to a negwo?</p>

<p><i>Zeb.</i> Molasses-color, molasses-color! dat’s all.</p>

<p><i>Simper.</i> Why, you infuwnal nigg&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Zeb.</i> Hey! what’s dat you call? Hey! what’s dat,
what den’s the Constitution say. Hey! (<i>flourishing razor.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Simper.</i> Good gwacious! put down that wazor!</p>

<p><i>Zeb.</i> What did the ’mancipation krocklamation do,
hey? (<i>Flourishing razor.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Simper.</i> Dear me! will you put down that wazor?</p>

<p><i>Zeb.</i> Nigah! by golly, if you ain’t dark complexed
yourself I’d&mdash;I’d&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Simper.</i> Help! murdew! put down that wazor!</p>

<p><i>Mike.</i> Faith, Zeb, if yer not quiet, out yer go.</p>

<p><i>Zeb.</i> Ob course, ob course! what’s the dec&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Mike.</i> Oh! whist wid yer blarney, and shave the
man.</p>

<p><i>Crusty.</i> Come, come, hurry up: will you never get
through?</p>

<p><i>Mike.</i> In a minute: aisy, aisy, sir! (<i>Enter <span class="smcap">Heavyface</span>.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Heavy.</i> Oh, yes! of course: all full, just as I
expected! That’s the way the world over: there’s nothing
but disappointment; every thing goes against me.</p>

<p><i>Mike.</i> Your turn next, sir.</p>

<p><i>Heavy.</i> Now, I suppose you call that consolation. I
tell you the world is all going wrong; there’s nothing but
misery and deceit in it. (<i>Takes a chair, and seats himself
between the two barber’s chairs.</i>) A man’s got no real
friends in this world: your riches are deceitful, your
dearest friend may be your foe. Now, I suppose you
two chaps feel perfectly comfortable in those chairs, with
a pair of grinning fiends standing over you with razors,
ready at the slightest provocation to plunge them in your
throats.</p>

There’s that barber, Tonsor, instead of attending to his

<p><i>Crusty.</i> Oh! you’re back,&mdash;are you? Now, you villain,
what do you mean by running off with my daughter?</p>

<p><i>Ton.</i> I beg your pardon, sir; but I couldn’t help it:
I was tempted.</p>

<p><i>Crusty.</i> Tempted by who?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Ton.</i> The writer of this note (<i>reads</i>). “Dear Parson,
Marry this couple quickly, and marry them strong. The
young man is worthy of any young lady in the place.
The father of the lady, an ugly old scamp, objects; but
I’ll give my consent and will pay all damages. Yours,
Jotham Crusty.” These were my instructions, which
I have carefully obeyed. I’ve brought back your chaise;
and you’ll find my wife in it ready to thank her dear
father for his thoughtful attention in giving her the
husband of her choice.</p>

<p><i>Heavy.</i> (<i>Who has taken barber’s chair vacated by
<span class="smcap">Crusty</span>.</i>) Crusty, you are slightly done.</p>

<p><i>Crusty.</i> Oh, yes! this is nuts for you, you sour old
hypochondriac. You think you are going to crow over
me; but you shan’t. I’ve lost a daughter, but I’ve found
a son. Here, Tonsor, here’s my hand: the old man’s
sold, and must own up. Sell out this business, shut up
shop, and come home.</p>

<p><i>Ton.</i> Thank you! I’ll sell at once. Here’s Mike:
he shall have it.</p>

<p><i>Crusty.</i> He! why, look at my face!</p>

<p><i>Ton.</i> We’ll set him up in business with Zeb.</p>

<p><i>Simper.</i> That horrid bawbaw! look at my ambwosials.</p>

<p><i>Mike.</i> Faix! I go into business wid dat black son
of Africa?</p>

<p><i>Zeb.</i> Hold yer hush! hold yer hush! dare’s no brack,
now. What doz the Declamation of Indecempendence
say?</p>

<p><i>Ton.</i> No matter what it says: you shall have the
business. So, after thanking all here for their kind attention<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
to my business while away, I will retire, as
there is only one thing I require,&mdash;their kind plaudits.</p>

<p><i>Crusty.</i> Hold on, Tonsor: there’s something else.
Here’s Simper: he’s lost a wife and half his whiskers;
I’ve lost a daughter and half mine; so I’ll take the chair.</p>

<p><i>Heavy.</i> Hold on! hold on! it’s my turn next!</p>

<p><i>Crusty.</i> Why, you’ve just been railing at barbers
and razors and the wickedness of the world: will you
put yourself in their hands?</p>

<p><i>Heavy.</i> To be sure I will. We’re all going to the
bad. I’m reconciled, and they can’t hurt me.</p>

<p><i>Crusty.</i> Well, have your turn; and, after you get
through, I’ll see if I can’t have what I came here for.</p>

<p><i>Ton.</i> What was that, father-in-law?</p>

<p><i>Crusty.</i> A clean shave.</p>

<p><i>Wiggins.</i> I am a lucky man! I should like to know
how many times an hour, by the most approved rules of
computation, that sentence escapes my lips; to how<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
many mirrors have I uttered those memorable words;
how many sheets of paper have been devastated with
that <i lang="la">multum in parvo</i> of sentences, I am a lucky man?
Look at me, Waldimer Wiggins, seventh son of Waldimer
Wiggins, the blacksmith, who was the seventh
son of Wigglesworth Wiggins, the cooper. I, who have
been knocked about the world like a shuttlecock, buffeted
by everybody and everything; who never saw but
one schoolhouse in all my life, and that from the outside,&mdash;here
am I puzzling all the learned doctors, creating a
frenzy among the apothecaries, and setting the whole
town to taking medicine by the pint, quart, and even
demijohn, and hauling greenbacks into my capacious
pockets with an agility and velocity that would astonish
the father of greenbacks. I am the lucky possessor of
the greatest remedy of modern times,&mdash;a medicine that
will cure anything and everything, anybody and everybody;
and where there is nothing to cure, will make
something, and then cure that. Men praise it, women
dote on it, and children cry for it. I am the lucky possessor
of this treasure, and yet I never received a diploma,
or even amused myself with the graceful but
rather monotonous exercise of the pestle and mortar.
As I before suggested, it’s all luck. I’ll tell you all
about it (<i>seats himself familiarly before the audience</i>).
Like Byron, that beautiful but dyspeptic poet, “I had a
dream.” It was one night after I had partaken of oysters.
I generally indulge in a light supper before retiring.
Upon this occasion it consisted of cold chicken,
mince pie, pigs’ feet, and, as I before remarked, oysters.
I had retired to my downy couch, when the following
striking tableau was presented in a vision. I beheld<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
the great Barnum, surrounded by greenbacks. On his
right were the Albino woman and Joyce Heath, on his
left, Tom Thumb and his Bride; while the “What is
it?” a little elevated, was crowning the great showman
with a wreath of posies. Of course my attention was
first attracted to the free exhibition of curiosities, but
after a careful examination of them, my eyes were fixed
upon the great “Supporter of the Moral Drama,” by
whom I was greeted with this characteristic original
remark, “How are you, Wiggins?” to which I answered,
as is customary in all polite circles, “How are
<em>you</em>, Barnum?” “Wiggins,” said he, “do you want to
make a fortune?” to which I responded, “I do.” “Then
look in ‘The Daily Slungshot,’ outside, first column,
top line, and obey the injunction there given.” I
thanked the great man, signified to him that I thought
him an immense individual, but that he could not keep
“The Aquarial Gardens.” He pronounced my remark
very of <em>fish</em> ous; and with this scaly joke, vanished. I
awoke, purchased “The Slungshot,” sought the designated
spot, and read this cabalistic word, “Advertise.”
It was enough. I remembered a recipe an Indian
woman had given me when a child. It was for curing
corns. I resolved to make a fortune from that. Now
everybody is not afflicted with corns; so, to have a striking
effect on all diseases, I call my medicine “The Great
Elixir,” and warrant it to cure everything. I might
easily show you how all diseases are first taken into the
system through the medium of corns, but as it would
take some time to convince you, I will not make the
attempt. Advertising has done the business for me, and
now everybody is taking The Great Elixir and blessing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
the name of Waldimer Wiggins. (<i>Rises, takes a seat at
table <span class="smcapuc">R.</span>, and opens letters, making memorandums on each
as read.</i>) Now, here is a string of correspondents that
would puzzle a regular physician, but which I, with my
superior skill, can dispose of in a very few moments.
(<i>Reads.</i>) Hm! an old lady has fits. (<i>Mem.</i>) Take The
Elixir three times a day. (<i>Reads.</i>) An old gentleman
with a bald head wants his hair to grow. (<i>Mem.</i>) Apply
The Elixir externally and internally three times a
day. (<i>Enter <span class="smcap">Dennis</span>, <span class="smcapuc">L.</span></i>) Well, Dennis, what is it?</p>

<p><i>Dennis.</i> Faith, I don’t know; there’s the kitchen
fire don’t burn at tall, at tall, and there’s a gintleman
wants to say the dochter.</p>

<p><i>Wiggins.</i> Show the gentleman in here, and put “The
Great Elixir” on the fire. If that wont make a blaze,
then nothing will. (<i>Exit, <span class="smcapuc">R.</span>, with letters.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Dennis.</i> Faith it’s an illigant man is the dochter. It’s
the&mdash;the learning he has onyhow, and it’s the fine physic
he makes. The Great Elixir. Put it in the fire? by my
sowl, I will do that same; and&mdash;and in the blacking
and in the soup. It’s meself that has a mind to take a
wee dhrap meself, for the sthrong wakness I have for
Judy Ryan. Bless her purty face! (<i>Enter <span class="smcap">Charles
Freedley</span>, <span class="smcapuc">L.</span></i>)</p>

<p><i>Charles.</i> Did you tell Dr. Wiggins I wished to speak
with him?</p>

<p><i>Dennis.</i> Indade I did, sir, and he’ll say yez in a minute.
(<i>Exit, <span class="smcapuc">L.</span></i>)</p>

<p><i>Charles.</i> So this is the office of the Great Doctor.
Great Fiddlesticks! He’s no more a doctor than I am,
and he shall own it, too, before I’ve done with him.
There’s my Aunt Hopkins, whose heir I expect to be,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
crazy about this Dr. Wiggins. Calls his “Great Elixir”
delightful, and vows she will leave him a legacy. Now
I have set my heart on possessing all the property of
Aunt Hopkins, and have no idea of parting with it to
such a humbug as this; and here I am on a voyage of
discovery, which will, I hope, end in the unmasking of
this quack. (<i>Enter <span class="smcap">Wiggins</span>, <span class="smcapuc">R.</span>, slowly, his eyes fastened
on an open book in his hand.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Wiggins.</i> Why is the privacy of the Seventh Son of
the Seventh Son thus intruded upon?</p>

<p><i>Charles.</i> Privacy? Why, aint you a regular physician?</p>

<p><i>Wiggins.</i> I am, very <em>regular</em>. My office hours are
from 10 <span class="smcap">A. M.</span> to 2 <span class="smcap">P. M.</span> The balance of my time is devoted
to the study of the human system; to poring over
the open book of nature, or to gazing in quiet, tranquil
solitude upon the sublime spectacles performed by stars
of the first magnitude.</p>

<p><i>Charles.</i> Oh! you mean at the theatres.</p>

<p><i>Wiggins.</i> Theatres, sir! No, sir, the study of the
heavens is enough for my inquiring mind. What want
you with me?</p>

<p><i>Charles.</i> I have a very painful malady.</p>

<p><i>Wiggins.</i> What is it?</p>

<p><i>Charles.</i> An itching sensation in my hand. (<i>Aside.</i>)
Itching to get hold of you.</p>

<p><i>Wiggins.</i> Let me look at it (<i>offering to take it</i>).</p>

<p><i>Charles</i> (<i>raising his arm quick, hits the doctor in the
stomach</i>). It hurts me when I raise it thus.</p>

<p><i>Wiggins</i> (<i>jumping back</i>). Oh! confound you! Then
why in the deuce do you raise it thus?</p>

<p><i>Charles.</i> I want it cured.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Wiggins</i> (<i>looking very wise</i>). Let me see. Mars in
the seventh heaven, and Jupiter in an eclipse, Venus in
a brown study, and Mercury in the blues. Young man,
the stars tell me you can be cured.</p>

<p><i>Charles.</i> Much obliged to the stars. How?</p>

<p><i>Wiggins</i> (<i>speaking very quick, as though repeating
an old story</i>). By a plentiful application of “The Great
Elixir,” which will cure coughs, colds, burns, bruises,
consumption, fits, fevers, earache, heartache, headache,
toothache, corns, bunions, etc., etc. Whose virtues are
known and appreciated from one end of the continent to
the other. Prepared under the special directions of the
stars, and sold by all respectable druggists at the low price
of one dollar a bottle.</p>

<p><i>Charles</i> (<i>aside</i>). Just as I thought, an ignorant
quack. (<i>Aloud.</i>) I will procure a bottle, and give it a
fair trial. (<i>Aside.</i>) I’d sooner take poison than his infernal
stuff. (<i>Exit, <span class="smcapuc">L.</span></i>)</p>

<p><i>Wiggins.</i> It is thus that science blesses her devotees
with the glow of success. (<i>Looking at watch.</i>) 10 o’clock!
We must prepare for the patients. Here, Dennis (<i>Enter
<span class="smcap">Dennis</span>, <span class="smcapuc">L.</span></i>), prepare the paraphernalia.</p>

<p><i>Dennis</i> (<i>puzzled</i>). The what is it?</p>

<p><i>Wiggins.</i> Prepare the paraphernalia.</p>

<p><i>Dennis.</i> Yis, sir, directly (<i>going, <span class="smcapuc">L.</span></i>).</p>

<p><i>Wiggins.</i> Where are you going?</p>

<p><i>Dennis.</i> For the razor, sir.</p>

<p><i>Wiggins.</i> Razor! What do you want of a razor?</p>

<p><i>Dennis.</i> To pare your nails ouv course. You
wouldn’t expect me to bring an axe.</p>

<p><i>Wiggins.</i> Oh, pshaw! Set out the table and put the
instruments upon it; it is time to receive patients.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Dennis.</i> Oh, yis, sir. (<i>Aside.</i>) Why don’t he spake
his mother tongue in the first place (<i>sets table in <span class="smcapuc">C.</span>,
takes from a drawer in the table a long carving-knife, a
saw, and other instruments, places them upon the table.
Wiggins seats himself at back of table pompously. Bell
rings outside</i>).</p>

<p><i>Wiggins.</i> Our first patient. Show him in, Dennis.</p>

<p><i>Dennis.</i> Yis, sir. (<i>Exit, <span class="smcapuc">L.</span></i>)</p>

<p><i>Wiggins.</i> Talk about your colleges! What is the good
of them while there’s newspapers to advertise in, and
people with throats large enough to swallow anything.
(<i>Enter <span class="smcap">Dennis</span> with <span class="smcap">Greenbax</span>, <span class="smcapuc">L.</span></i>) Hallo, who’s
this?</p>

<p><i>Dennis.</i> Here you are, sir; that’s the doctor; be quick,
for he’s awful busy.</p>

<p><i>Greenbax.</i> Dizzy! I should think so; it’s enough to
make anybody dizzy climbing so many stairs. Where’s
the doctor?</p>

<p><i>Dennis.</i> There he is in his place!</p>

<p><i>Greenbax.</i> Wrong place! Why didn’t you tell me
so before?</p>

<p><i>Dennis.</i> What a stupid ould man.</p>

<p><i>Wiggins</i> (<i>coming forward</i>). Here’s a queer customer.
What do you want?</p>

<p><i>Greenbax.</i> Hey?</p>

<p><i>Wiggins.</i> Do you want the doctor?</p>

<p><i>Greenbax.</i> Of course I do (<i>going</i>).</p>

<p><i>Wiggins.</i> Hold on, I am the doctor.</p>

<p><i>Greenbax.</i> Hey?</p>

<p><i>Wiggins.</i> I am the doctor.</p>

<p><i>Greenbax.</i> Yes, yes, I want the doctor.</p>

<p><i>Wiggins</i> (<i>very loud</i>). I am the doctor. Stupid!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Greenbax.</i> No, no! Dr. Wiggins, not Dr. Stupid.</p>

<p><i>Wiggins</i> (<i>shouting</i>). I am Dr. Wiggins. Who are
you?</p>

<p><i>Greenbax</i> (<i>holding out his hand</i>). Pretty well, I
thank you; a little deafness for you to cure, that’s all.</p>

<p><i>Wiggins.</i> How long have you been so?</p>

<p><i>Greenbax.</i> Yes, it does look like snow, but I think it
will turn to rain.</p>

<p><i>Wiggins.</i> How long have you been in this condition?</p>

<p><i>Greenbax.</i> Awful bad condition. I went over shoes
in mud getting here.</p>

<p><i>Wiggins.</i> Oh, pshaw! what’s to be done with him?
(<i>Still louder.</i>) Does your deafness increase?</p>

<p><i>Greenbax.</i> Hey?</p>

<p><i>Wiggins</i> (<i>shouting</i>). Do you keep getting worse?</p>

<p><i>Greenbax.</i> Oh, yes! I keep a horse,&mdash;fast one, too.</p>

<p><i>Wiggins.</i> I am speaking about your ear.</p>

<p><i>Greenbax.</i> Yes, I’ve had him about a year. He
has the heaves a little.</p>

<p><i>Wiggins</i> (<i>shouting</i>). I’m talking about you&mdash;you&mdash;you!</p>

<p><i>Greenbax.</i> Me! oh, no! I never had the heaves.</p>

<p><i>Wiggins.</i> Oh, dear, dear! what shall I do? (<i>Shouting.</i>)
Have you ever tried The Elixir?</p>

<p><i>Greenbax.</i> No, sir, I never do. The hostler he licks
her sometimes.</p>

<p><i>Wiggins</i> (<i>desperately takes bottle from table</i>). Here,
take this three times a day.</p>

<p><i>Greenbax.</i> Certainly, with pleasure. I’ll take it to
Mr. Day. Go right by his house.</p>

<p><i>Wiggins</i> (<i>shouting</i>). No, no; take it yourself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Greenbax.</i> Oh, yes; for my ear.</p>

<p><i>Wiggins.</i> Apply it externally and internally.</p>

<p><i>Greenbax</i> (<i>looking at bottle</i>). It does have an infernal
look. Oh, I’ve tried this, it wont do. Must have
something stronger,&mdash;something to shake me up.</p>

<p><i>Wiggins.</i> I must try something else. What shall it
be? I’ll mix something to warm him up. I will return
in a moment. (<i>Exit, <span class="smcapuc">R.</span></i>)</p>

<p><i>Dennis.</i> What an ould heathen! he’s as deaf as ould
Mother Mullin’s cow, that was so deaf she couldn’t say
straight. What’s the matter wid his ears? they’re long
enough onyhow. (<i>To Greenbax.</i>) Servant, sir!</p>

<p><i>Greenbax.</i> Hey?</p>

<p><i>Dennis.</i> It’s a fine day, sir.</p>

<p><i>Greenbax.</i> No. Nothing to give away. Go to the
poorhouse.</p>

<p><i>Dennis.</i> Poorhouse, is it, you thaif!</p>

<p><i>Wiggins</i> (<i>outside</i>). Dennis!</p>

<p><i>Dennis.</i> Coming, sir. Away wid yez, you deaf ould
haddock. (<i>Exit, <span class="smcapuc">R.</span></i>)</p>

<p><i>Greenbax.</i> So many beggars about. Strange the
police will allow it. (<i>Re-enter <span class="smcap">Dennis</span>, <span class="smcapuc">R.</span>, with a
phial.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Dennis.</i> I’m to give the deaf fellow, then, this bottle,
and he’s to follow the directions. What’s that? (<i>Reads
label.</i>) “To be well shaken before taken.” Faith, my
boy, I’ll do that same for yez. (<i>Seizing Greenbax and
shaking him.</i>) Ye’d have me go to the poorhouse, would
yez?</p>

<p><i>Greenbax.</i> Murder, murder!</p>

<p><i>Dennis</i> (<i>shaking him</i>). Howl away, ye spalpeen.
’Twill help the circulation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Greenbax.</i> Murder, murder!</p>

<p><i>Dennis.</i> Once more, ould man, and then ye’ll do.</p>

<p><i>Greenbax.</i> Murder, help, murder! (<i>Enter <span class="smcap">Wiggins</span>, <span class="smcapuc">R.</span></i>)</p>

<p><i>Wiggins.</i> What are you doing, you scamp?</p>

<p><i>Dennis.</i> Faith, obeying orders, to be sure. “To be
well shaken before taken.”</p>

<p><i>Wiggins.</i> You stupid blockhead! I meant the medicine,
and not the patient.</p>

<p><i>Dennis.</i> Oh, murder! I thought it was the ould
man.</p>

<p><i>Wiggins</i> (<i>shouting</i>). I’m sorry this happened; ’twas
all a mistake.</p>

<p><i>Greenbax.</i> Yes. It was a pretty good shake.</p>

<p><i>Wiggins.</i> My man will be more careful in future.
(<i>Gives him phial.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Greenbax.</i> Shall I take this?</p>

<p><i>Wiggins.</i> Yes, morning and night.</p>

<p><i>Greenbax.</i> Oh, no! I wont get tight. I belong to
the temperance society. Good-by. (<i>Exit, <span class="smcapuc">L.</span></i>)</p>

<p><i>Wiggins.</i> There’s one disposed of. Who’s the next,
Dennis?</p>

<p><i>Dennis.</i> Mr. Aspen, the shaky gintleman.</p>

<p><i>Wiggins.</i> Oh, yes! Show him in, Dennis. (<i>Exit
<span class="smcap">Dennis</span>, <span class="smcapuc">L.</span></i>) My nervous patient; we must shake <em>him</em>
up a little. (<i>Re-enter Dennis with Aspen, who is very

his cane, and then his gloves (to be continued). Wiggins

and during the scene with Aspen flourishes the carving-knife,
scrapes it on the table, etc., to frighten Aspen.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Wiggins.</i> Good-morning, Mr. Aspen. Take a seat.
How do you feel this morning?</p>

<p><i>Aspen</i> (<i>sits <span class="smcapuc">L.</span> of table</i>). Oh, I don’t know, I
guess&mdash;I think&mdash;I should say&mdash;I must be-er&mdash;kind-er&mdash;sort-er&mdash;I
don’t know.</p>

<p><i>Dennis.</i> Faith! He’s getting no better very fast.</p>

<p><i>Wiggins.</i> A decided improvement. How much of
the Elixir have you taken?</p>

<p><i>Aspen.</i> Two dozen bottles.</p>

<p><i>Wiggins.</i> Not enough. You must take a gross.</p>

<p><i>Dennis.</i> Not enough. You must take a gross
(<i>flourishing knife</i>).</p>

<p><i>Aspen</i> (<i>shaking</i>). A gross? Oh, dear!</p>

<p><i>Wiggins.</i> Perhaps a barrel.</p>

<p><i>Dennis.</i> A barrel (<i>flourishing knife</i>).</p>

<p><i>Wiggins.</i> Your nervous, bilious organization is
completely prostrated by sudden and repeated attacks
of dorrammomphia, and an enlargement of the ambigular
excrescences in the influctions of the cornicopia.</p>

<p><i>Dennis.</i> D’ye mind that now? (<i>knife.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Wiggins.</i> You must continue the Elixir night and
day, and in six or seven years you will be entirely cured.</p>

<p><i>Dennis.</i> Yes, skewered (<i>knife</i>).</p>

<p><i>Aspen.</i> But it makes me so horrid sick.</p>

<p><i>Wiggins.</i> What if it does?</p>

<p><i>Dennis.</i> What if it does? (<i>knife.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Aspen</i> (<i>rising</i>). Well, no matter, I’ll take it. Take
a barrel of that nasty stuff. Oh, dear! (<i>Exit with
Dennis, <span class="smcapuc">L.</span></i>)</p>

<p><i>Wiggins.</i> That is one of my best patients. With a
little moral suasion, I shall be able to make him swallow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
a hogshead of the Elixir. (<i>Enter Dennis, <span class="smcapuc">L.</span></i>) Well,
Dennis, who now?</p>

<p><i>Dennis.</i> Major Fingers, sir. (<i>Exit Dennis, <span class="smcapuc">L.</span></i>)</p>

<p><i>Wiggins.</i> Major Fingers! who the deuce is Major
Fingers? It must be a military man. I’m afraid of
those chaps. I’ll tell Dennis I can’t receive him.
(<i>Starts for door, <span class="smcapuc">L.</span>, and nearly upsets Major Fingers,
who enters.</i>) Excuse me, sir, I didn’t see you.</p>

<p><i>Major</i> (<i>fiercely</i>). Didn’t see me, stupid, swords and
bayonets! Is this the way you receive patients?</p>

<p><i>Wiggins.</i> Excuse me, sir; but you are so diminutive.</p>

<p><i>Major.</i> Diminutive, sir! Look at my face! look at
that moustache! Is there anything diminutive about
that? I’d have you know, sir, that I am the equal of
any man, in intellect, sir.</p>

<p><i>Wiggins.</i> I really beg your pardon. To what do I
owe the honor of this visit?</p>

<p><i>Major.</i> My name is Fingers. I called to see you
about my wife.</p>

<p><i>Wiggins.</i> Your wife? You mean your mother.</p>

<p><i>Major.</i> Swords and bayonets! sir, what do you
mean? My wife, I said. Didn’t you know I was
married? I thought everybody knew it. Married in
New York. Great <i lang="fr">eclat</i>. Everybody turned out.
Married in style, style. Yes, sir, style.</p>

<p><i>Wiggins</i> (<i>aside</i>). What a young bantam.</p>

<p><i>Major.</i> Now, sir, I have come to you on a very important
matter. No listeners about, hey?</p>

<p><i>Wiggins.</i> Not a soul.</p>

<p><i>Major.</i> Then listen. When I was married I took
a beautiful young lady of my own size. Perhaps you’d
like to know the reason. I had been my own master so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
long that I could not bear to have a woman rule over
me, so, although I have had many ladies at my feet, I
waited until I met my “Vene.”</p>

<p><i>Wiggins.</i> Your Vene?</p>

<p><i>Major.</i> Yes, my “Vene,”&mdash;short for Lavinia, my
wife.</p>

<p><i>Wiggins.</i> Oh! I see. Short wife, short name.</p>

<p><i>Major</i> (<i>fiercely</i>). Sir!</p>

<p><i>Wiggins.</i> Oh, no offence intended.</p>

<p><i>Major.</i> Well, sir, soon after my marriage, my
“Vene” undertook to tell <em>me</em>, her lord and master, that
if I stopped out after ten o’clock, she would turn the key
on me. Think of that!</p>

<p><i>Wiggins.</i> It’s outrageous.</p>

<p><i>Major.</i> Now, sir, seeing the advertisement of your
“Great Elixir,” I have called to see if it will do what it
pretends,&mdash;a miracle,&mdash;and make a tall man of me.</p>

<p><i>Wiggins.</i> Make a tall man of you? (<i>Aside.</i>)
Here’s a job. What’s to be done? I must get him for
a customer; he’s rich. (<i>Aloud.</i>) Yes, sir, the Elixir
will cause you to grow right out of your boots. You
shall see a specimen of its working. Dennis! (<i>Enter
Dennis, <span class="smcapuc">L.</span></i>) Where’s Bob?</p>

<p><i>Dennis.</i> Down-stairs, sir.</p>

<p><i>Wiggins.</i> Send him up. (<i>Dennis going.</i>) And
hark you, Dennis. (<i>Whispers.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Dennis.</i> All right. I understand. (<i>Exit, <span class="smcapuc">L.</span></i>)</p>

<p><i>Wiggins.</i> Be seated, major, and you shall see a
specimen of the miraculous effects of the Elixir. (<i>Enter
Bob, with a long cloak on his shoulders and a fur
cap on his head.</i>) What are you doing in that rig?
Do you think it is winter?</p>

<p><i>Bob.</i> Please, sir, I can’t help it. I’ve got the influendways
awful, and I’m so cold.</p>

<p><i>Wiggins.</i> I’ll soon warm you. (<i>Takes bottle from

growing medicine. (<i>Bob takes the medicine and
grows.</i>)<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p><i>Wiggins.</i> Well, major, what do you say to that?</p>

<p><i>Major.</i> It’s wonderful. But will it do the same
for me?</p>

<p><i>Wiggins.</i> Certainly it will.</p>

<p><i>Major.</i> Then send a dozen bottles to my hotel, at
once. Oh, “Vene,” “Vene,” you shall find <em>I</em> am the
head of the family. (<i>Struts out, <span class="smcapuc">L.</span></i>)</p>

<p><i>Wiggins.</i> That’s a queer case; first of the kind on
my list. Hope it will prove a success. (<i>Enter Dennis,
<span class="smcapuc">L.</span></i>)</p>

<p><i>Dennis.</i> There’s two snobs want to see the doctor.</p>

<p><i>Wiggins.</i> Snobs? Come, come, sir, a little more
respect.</p>

<p><i>Dennis.</i> Well, then, gents.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Wiggins.</i> Bring them in, and I will see them in a

<p><i>Dennis</i> (<i>calling, <span class="smcapuc">L.</span></i>). Hallo, you, this way. (<i>Enter
Harry and Herbert, <span class="smcapuc">L.</span></i>) The doctor will see you in a
jiffy. (<i>Exit, <span class="smcapuc">L.</span></i>)</p>

<p><i>Herbert.</i> So, Harry, you have at last followed the
fashion and been caught by the advertisement of a
quack?</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> Not caught, as you imagine. The fact is,
Herbert, I want something novel for my new play, and
hearing this fellow pretends to be an astrologer, I want
to know what he can tell me through the medium of
the stars.</p>

<p><i>Herbert.</i> Stars? I should think you were pretty
well posted regarding them. By the way, what is the
plot of your new piece?</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> About as usual. A man who possesses a
secret, another who would go through fire and water to
find it out.</p>

<p><i>Herbert.</i> Blood and thunder school?</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> Rather. But my villain,&mdash;he’s a character,&mdash;he
does the murder admirably.</p>

<p><i>Herbert.</i> Murder! (<i>Enter Wiggins, <span class="smcapuc">R.</span></i>)</p>

<p><i>Wiggins.</i> Murder! (<i>Starts back and conceals himself,
<span class="smcapuc">R.</span></i>)</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> Listen. (<i>In melodramatic style recites.</i>)
“He possesses the secret by which I might obtain gold!
gold! gold! He keeps me from that secret. But I
have him in my power. I am now beneath his roof.
I know all the secret windings of the various passages,
and at the dread hour of midnight I will steal to his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
apartment, and with my dagger over his head will shout
in his ear, Blood! Blood! Blood! and bury it in his
heart. Then the secret is mine and mine alone.” Sh!
(<i>Enter Wiggins, <span class="smcapuc">R.</span></i>) The doctor.</p>

<p><i>Wiggins</i> (<i>aside</i>). Oh, dear! I see it all. I’m a
doomed man. It’s all up with me. But I must appear
calm. (<i>Trembles violently.</i>) Wh-wh-wh-at d-d-d-o you
w-w-want?</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> Are you the physician?</p>

<p><i>Wiggins.</i> Yes. That is&mdash;no&mdash;no&mdash;oh! Blood!
Blood! Blood!</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> Blood? I thought it was Wiggins.</p>

<p><i>Wiggins.</i> It is. It is Wh-Wh-Wh-ig-ig-ins.</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> I have a nervous affection for which I wish
to be doctored. A spasmodic moving of the arm at
times.</p>

<p><i>Wiggins.</i> Yes, I know. “At the dread hour of midnight.”</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> What shall I do for it?</p>

<p><i>Wiggins</i> (<i>fiercely</i>). Go home, put your head in a
basin of gruel&mdash;no&mdash;no; put a basin of gruel on your
feet and&mdash;The dread hour of midnight! Oh! oh!
(<i>Sinks into a chair.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> Why, what’s the matter?</p>

<p><i>Wiggins</i> (<i>jumps up</i>). Matter? Murder, robbery,
cold steel! That’s what’s the matter. Go home; stay
at home. Your disease is fatal if you stir from home for
the next fourteen years, especially (<i>aside</i>) at the dread
hour of midnight. (<i>Sinks into chair.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> But the remedy, your great secret?</p>

<p><i>Wiggins</i> (<i>aside</i>). There it is, my great secret<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
(<i>jumping up</i>). Go home, I say. Do as I tell you, or
your life isn’t worth a lucifer match.</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> This is a very queer doctor. Come, Herbert,
let’s go. I will call again, when you are more calm and
quiet. (<i>Exit Harry and Herbert, <span class="smcapuc">L.</span></i>)</p>

<p><i>Wiggins.</i> Yes, I know, “at the dread hour of midnight.”
What’s to be done? This sanguinary ruffian
who is bound to obtain the secret of “The Great Elixir.”
I always had an idea that I should be martyred for the
knowledge I possess. I wish I was rid of the Great
Elixir. Oh, Wigglesworth Wiggins, I wish you had
been in the seventh heavens, ere you had made me the
seventh son of a seventh son! (<i>Enter Dennis, <span class="smcapuc">L.</span>, with
lunch on a waiter.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Dennis.</i> Here’s your lunch, sir (<i>places it on table</i>).</p>

<p><i>Wiggins.</i> Lunch! A pretty time to think of lunch.
(<i>Aside.</i>) I must make a confidant of Dennis. Perhaps
he can assist me. Dennis!</p>

<p><i>Dennis.</i> Yes, sir.</p>

<p><i>Wiggins.</i> What would you do to get hold of such a
secret as that of the Great Elixir?</p>

<p><i>Dennis.</i> Faith! I’d go through fire and water to
get a hould of it.</p>

<p><i>Wiggins</i> (<i>aside</i>). Oh, murder! Suppose he should
forestall the ruffians! Would you shed blood, blood,
blood?</p>

<p><i>Dennis.</i> No, no, no, divil a hape.</p>

<p><i>Wiggins</i> (<i>aside</i>). He can be trusted. Dennis, my
life is in danger. Two ruffians are coming here at the
dread hour of midnight, shout blood, blood, blood in my
ear, and then murder me.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Dennis.</i> Murder and Irish! An’ will they wake yez
afterwards?</p>

<p><i>Wiggins.</i> What’s to be done?</p>

<p><i>Dennis.</i> Divil a bit do I know, onyhow. Fasthen the
door.</p>

<p><i>Wiggins.</i> But they know a secret entrance.</p>

<p><i>Dennis.</i> Then fasthen the gate and throw the kay
down the well.</p>

<p><i>Wiggins.</i> No, no! (<i>Fingers heard outside crying.</i>)
Who is that?</p>

<p><i>Dennis</i> (<i>going to door, <span class="smcapuc">L.</span></i>) It’s Major Fingers in
trouble. (<i>Enter Major Fingers, <span class="smcapuc">L.</span>, rubbing his eyes
and bawling. Exit Dennis, <span class="smcapuc">L.</span></i>)</p>

<p><i>Major.</i> Oh, dear! Doctor, what shall I do?&mdash;what
shall I do? I went home and took a dose of your Great
Elixir, and then, oh, dear! I was a goin’ to take another,
when “Vene,” sh-sh-she took it away from me
and th-th-threw it out of the window, and then boxed
my ears. What shall I do?&mdash;what shall I do?</p>

<p><i>Wiggins.</i> Do? Why, get a divorce.</p>

<p><i>Major.</i> So I will, see if I don’t. I’ll never sleep,
drink, eat&mdash; (<i>spies doctor’s lunch on table</i>). Hallo!
what’s that? (<i>Seizes lunch.</i>) Cake, oh, my! (<i>Stuffs
it into his mouth.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Wiggins.</i> Come, come, sir, that’s my lunch.</p>

<p><i>Major.</i> Can’t you allow me a little comfort after I’ve
been abused by “Vene”? (<i>Continues eating. Enter
Dennis, <span class="smcapuc">L.</span>, hurriedly.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Dennis.</i> Oh, murder, murder! Here’s a row. Here’s
a shindy. Doctor, you’re a dead man.</p>

<p><i>Wiggins.</i> Oh, Lord! What’s the matter now?</p>

<p><i>Dennis.</i> Mr. Freedley, who took the prescription<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
this morning, took the Great Elixir, and then was took
crazy intirely. He’s left his house, and his friends have
jist been here after him.</p>

<p><i>Wiggins.</i> Why here?</p>

<p><i>Dennis.</i> Because he’s raving about the doctor, and
swearing he’ll have his life.</p>

<p><i>Wiggins.</i> Oh, horror! What’s to be done? Oh,
that infernal Elixir!</p>

<p><i>Charles</i> (<i>outside, <span class="smcapuc">L.</span></i>). Where is he? Where is the
destroyer of my peace?</p>

<p><i>Wiggins.</i> Here comes the madman. (<i>Gets <span class="smcapuc">R.</span> Dennis
runs behind the table, seizing the carving-knife.
Major Fingers crawls under the table with the lunch.
Enter Charles, <span class="smcapuc">L.</span>, in pantaloons and white shirt, with
a sheet draped about his body. A wreath of straw “à
la King Lear” on his head, his face whitened.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Charles</i> (<i>gesticulating wildly</i>). There he is! Grinning
demon, why do you defy me? (<i>makes a dash at
Wiggins, who escapes to <span class="smcapuc">L.</span></i>)</p>

<p><i>Wiggins.</i> Please, sir, I don’t know. I am an unfortunate
man.</p>

<p><i>Charles.</i> Liar! You have robbed me of that which
time can never restore.</p>

<p><i>Dennis.</i> Somebody’s stole his watch.</p>

<p><i>Charles.</i> Villain, destroyer of my peace, vile caitiff,
thou must die! I will have thy heart’s blood. (<i>Makes
another dash at Wiggins, who escapes to <span class="smcapuc">R.</span></i>)</p>

<p><i>Wiggins.</i> Here’s another wants blood, blood, blood!</p>

<p><i>Charles.</i> Silence, demon! Where’s my wife?</p>

<p><i>Major.</i> Oh, dear, me! where’s mine?</p>

<p><i>Charles.</i> My wife, my wife, my wife!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Dennis.</i> That’s three wives. That fellar’s a Mormon.</p>

<p><i>Charles</i> (<i>seizing Wiggins and dragging him to centre</i>).
Now, demon, I have thee in my grasp, and if
ever you escape, it shall be with the everlasting curses
of Black Ralph.</p>

<p><i>Wiggins</i> (<i>on his knees</i>). Murder! He will strangle
me.</p>

<p><i>Dennis.</i> Watch! Watch!</p>

<p><i>Major.</i> Barnum! Barnum!</p>

<p><i>Charles.</i> Villain, confess your sins at once.</p>

<p><i>Wiggins.</i> Please, Mr. Black Ralph, I haven’t got
any.</p>

<p><i>Charles.</i> ’Tis false! Confess yourself a vile impostor.</p>

<p><i>Wiggins.</i> Well, well, I am.</p>

<p><i>Charles.</i> Your Great Elixir is&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Wiggins.</i> A humbug. (<i>Enter Greenbax and Aspen,
<span class="smcapuc">L.</span></i>)</p>

<p><i>Charles.</i> Repeat it before these gentlemen.</p>

<p><i>Wiggins.</i> I am a humbug. My Elixir is a humbug,
and everything is a humbug. Now let me go (<i>rises</i>).</p>

<p><i>Aspen.</i> Have I been deceived? Oh, you villain!</p>

<p><i>Greenbax.</i> What ails the doctor?</p>

<p><i>Dennis.</i> His nerves are a little shaken.</p>

<p><i>Greenbax.</i> No, no! I don’t want to be shaken.</p>

<p><i>Major.</i> What! sha’n’t I be a tall man?</p>

<p><i>Dennis.</i> Nary at all, at all.</p>

<p><i>Major.</i> Wont “Vene” make me pay for this?</p>

<p><i>Charles.</i> Now, Mr. Doctor, you can go (<i>removing
wreath</i>). You see I have recovered my senses. I have
exposed your quackery. I’ll give you three hours to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
leave town; if you are not gone then, I’ll hand you
over to the police.</p>

<p><i>Wiggins</i> (<i>aside</i>). What a fool I’ve been! (<i>Enter
Harry and Herbert, <span class="smcapuc">L.</span></i>) There are the ruffians. Seize
them! I charge those two individuals with a conspiracy
to murder me at the dread hour of midnight. Blood!
blood! blood!</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> Why, Charley, what does this mean?</p>

<p><i>Charles.</i> That I have exposed a quack, and saved my
Aunt Hopkins from making a fool of herself.</p>

<p><i>Wiggins.</i> But I charge these villains with an attempt
to murder me. Did you not a short time since,
in this very room, concoct a vile plot to murder me at
the dread hour of midnight?</p>

<p><i>Herbert.</i> Ha, ha, ha! Harry, your new play has
evidently made an impression on the doctor.</p>

<p><i>Wiggins.</i> Play?</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> Yes, play. Waiting for you, I entertained
my friend, here, with an extract from my new play.
Would you like to hear it again?</p>

<p><i>Wiggins.</i> No, I thank you. Fooled again. Here’s
a pretty kettle of fish. The Great Elixir exploded and
its great inventor obliged to leave town by rail or on a
rail. What shall I do? Mr. Greenbax,&mdash;you like my
Elixir; don’t you?</p>

<p><i>Greenbax.</i> Hey?</p>

<p><i>Wiggins.</i> You like my Elixir; don’t you?</p>

<p><i>Greenbax.</i> Oh, yes, I use it in my house.</p>

<p><i>Wiggins.</i> You hear that, gentlemen?</p>

<p><i>Charley.</i> What for, Mr. Greenbax?</p>

<p><i>Greenbax.</i> To kill rats. It’s a dead shot.</p>

<p><i>Wiggins.</i> But you like it, Mr. Aspen?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Aspen</i> (<i>shaking</i>). No, no, it’s villanous.</p>

<p><i>Dennis.</i> Bedad, if it’s like you, it’s no great shakes.</p>

<p><i>Wiggins.</i> Major, I can still depend upon you for a
customer?</p>

<p><i>Major.</i> Not much. “Vene” called you a quack.</p>

<p><i>Dennis.</i> Faith, “Vene” ought to know, for she’s a
duck herself.</p>

<p><i>Wiggins.</i> All forsake me. “The Great Elixir” is
doomed. No, it isn’t. (<i>To audience.</i>) Ladies and
gentlemen, you have had a dose of it to-night; may I
hope that you will recommend it. It may not perform
all the wonderful cures it pretends. What medicine
can? If it has pleased you, and you are inclined to
take another dose, my purpose here is accomplished, and
I shall still have great faith in the power of The Great
Elixir.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_3" id="Footnote_3"></a><a href="#FNanchor_3"><span class="label">[3]</span></a> This feat of growing is performed by a well-known trick.
Bob’s cap is fastened to the cloak behind; he carries a long stick
concealed beneath the cloak, one end of which is placed in the
cap; after drinking, he turns his back, goes to the wall, and gradually
raises the stick, of course raising the cap and cloak. Commencing
at <span class="smcapuc">R.</span> and going towards the <span class="smcapuc">L.</span>, raising and lowering the
stick, bobbing here and there, it has the appearance of a growing
man; when he reaches the door, <span class="smcapuc">L.</span>, he suddenly lowers it and exits.
Should this be found too difficult to perform, the piece is so arranged
as to admit of “cutting” by leaving out the characters of
Major Fingers and Bob, of course, omitting all the “lines” of
Wiggins and Dennis referring to this scene.</p>

<p class="scene"><span class="smcap">Scene.</span>&mdash;<i>Back street in Boston. Should it not be convenient

<p class="center"><i>Enter <span class="smcap">Phil</span>, <span class="smcapuc">L.</span></i></p>

<p><i>Phil.</i> Well, if this isn’t particularly pleasant! I’ve
been roaming round town ever since the break of day,
longing and waiting for my bitters. Dead broke, bank<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
closed, and credit exhausted. Nobody asks me to take
a drop. The landlords won’t treat, and I can’t find a
copper in the gutter. I have begged of everybody I
met; but it’s no use. One man said he would give me
a loaf of bread. Bread!&mdash;do I look like a man that wants
bread? No, I want something to drink: when I can’t get
that, I’ll begin to think about bread. Another man said
he would give me a breakfast if I would work for him
an hour. Work! I never did work, and I don’t think I
shall begin now. I’m one of the aristocracy; they
don’t work; society takes care of them when they’re
unfortunate: so let society take care of me. I wish I
could find a dollar, or a half a dollar, or a quarter, or
a ten-cent bit, or&mdash; (<i>Enter <span class="smcap">Ned</span>, <span class="smcapuc">R.</span></i>) Halloo, Ned! is
that you?</p>

<p><i>Ned.</i> Yes, all there is left of me! What are you
doing down there?</p>

<p><i>Phil.</i> Looking for my diamond pin. But what’s the
matter with you? You look as though, like me, you
hadn’t had your bitters this morning.</p>

<p><i>Ned.</i> No, I haven’t had my bitters; and that’s what’s
the matter. This is an ungrateful country! Why don’t
it take care of its “bone and sinew” better. There’s
those chaps at the State House mighty civil to you
just before election. Plenty of liquor then,&mdash;enough to
float us all.</p>

<p><i>Phil.</i> That’s why we are called the floating population,&mdash;hey,
Ned?</p>

<p><i>Ned.</i> But no sooner is election over than they shut
themselves up, won’t treat themselves, and go to making
laws against selling liquor, which prevents their constituents<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
from obtaining the necessities of life. There’s
gratitude for you.</p>

<p><i>Phil.</i> Put not your trust in princes, Ned.</p>

<p><i>Ned.</i> Trust! I wish I could find somebody to trust
me. I wasted my valuable time last night in Steve
Foster’s bar-room, laying round to get asked to drink;
and I was asked. And Steve Foster made money by my
being there; and now this morning, when I ask him for a
drop of gin, he says, “Where’s your money?”&mdash;“Ain’t
got any,” was my reply; and then, before I had time
to explain things, he gives me a lift, and sends me into
the gutter. I say this is an ungrateful country, where a
hard-working man like me is used in this way.</p>

<p><i>Phil.</i> Hard-working man you are! What do you
work at?</p>

<p><i>Ned.</i> Yes, hard-working indeed. Don’t I inspect
liquors that go into Steve Foster’s cellar, to see that they
are genuine?</p>

<p><i>Phil.</i> How, pray?</p>

<p><i>Ned.</i> By smelling round his cellar windows. Do you
think I don’t <em>nose</em> good liquor?</p>

<p><i>Phil.</i> Well, I guess we don’t either of us “nose”
much liquor this morning.</p>

<p><i>Ned.</i> Look here, Phil: when I was in Steve Foster’s
just now, a greenhorn was buying some liquor. I don’t
know what it was; but it was put up in a demijohn.
There he is now (<i>pointing, <span class="smcapuc">L.</span></i>), coming this way. If we
can only manage to get possession of that demijohn, we’re
safe for one drink at least.</p>

<p><i>Phil.</i> Good! let’s try it on,&mdash;pass ourselves off for
State constables, give him a scare.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Ned.</i> All right, stand back, here he is! (<i>They retire
back. Enter <span class="smcap">Zeke</span>, <span class="smcapuc">L.</span>, with demijohn.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Zeke.</i> I declare I feel about as mean as old Deacon
Smithers did when he split his bran-new, brass-button,
Sunday-go-to-meeting coat clean up the back while he
was on his knees to Aunt Nabby’s darter Susan,
popping the question, and she wouldn’t have him
neither? Here am I Zekiel Short, Corresponding
Secretary to the Rocky-valley Teetotalers, sneaking
through the streets of Boston with a demijohn in my
hand. I daren’t look a decent man in the face; and as
for the gals&mdash;Christopher! the sight of one on ’em makes
me blush way up to the roots of my hair. Catch me in
such a scrape again! Got all my groceries and fixin’s
up to the cars fust-rate, all ready for a start, when I
happened to think that our apothecary wanted me to
bring up something for him to make matrimonial wine
of&mdash;no, that ain’t it; antimonial wine,&mdash;something for
sick folks: and he wanted to get the poorest and cheapest
stuff that I could scare up; and I rather think I have
something that will suit him. I can smell turpentine
way through that demijohn; and I shouldn’t wonder if it
eat its way out afore I got home. I shouldn’t like to have
any of our folks see me in this pickle, they’d have me
up for backslidin’ sure as preaching. (<i>Phil and Ned have
been prowling round Zeke during this speech eyeing him
and the demijohn.</i>) Neow, what’s them are chaps eyeing
me for? I wonder if they’re State constables. How do
you do, sir?</p>

<p><i>Phil.</i> Sha’n’t I assist you with that demijohn, Mr.
Johnson?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Zeke.</i> No, I thank you; and my name ain’t Johnson,
nor demi-Johnson either.</p>

<p><i>Ned.</i> Sha’n’t I assist you, Mr. Eh&mdash;&mdash; Mr. Eh&mdash;&mdash;?</p>

<p><i>Zeke.</i> Well, I guess not; and my name ain’t Mr.
Eh&mdash;&mdash;.</p>

<p><i>Phil.</i> Do let me take it for you, you look fatigued.</p>

<p><i>Zeke.</i> Do I? well, so do you. You look kinder peaked,
as though you’d slept on the top of the meeting-house
steeple, and had to shin down the lightning-rod afore
breakfast, with nary a streak of lightning to grease your
way.</p>

<p><i>Ned.</i> You’d better let my friend carry it for you.
He’s used to carrying such things.</p>

<p><i>Zeke.</i> Well, I haven’t the least doubt of that. You
both look as though you could carry a great quantity
of this article. I’ll carry it myself; but I’m just as
much obliged to you; and, to show my gratitude, won’t
you take something?</p>

<p><i>Zeke.</i> Well, s’pose you take a walk.</p>

<p><i>Phil.</i> Look here, Mr. What’s-your-name. There’s just
enough of this. I’ll take that demijohn. I’m a State
constable.</p>

<p><i>Zeke.</i> A what?</p>

<p><i>Ned.</i> A State constable. So am I. Our orders are
to arrest all suspicious persons with demijohns.</p>

<p><i>Zeke.</i> Sho, are you, though? State constables! well,
I declare, I never should have thought it!</p>

<p><i>Phil.</i> So I’ll thank you for that demijohn.</p>

<p><i>Zeke.</i> <em>State constables!</em> Well, I declare! Want<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
my demijohn too? Do you know where I came
from?</p>

<p><i>Phil.</i> Yes: from the Rural District.</p>

<p><i>Zeke.</i> Rural? where’s that? No, sir: I’m from
Rocky-valley District; and, when a constable asks us for a
demijohn in that style, we say, “Where’s your warrant?”</p>

<p><i>Phil.</i> Oh! you do, do you? Well, a warrant isn’t
necessary here; so give up your demijohn.</p>

<p><i>Ned.</i> Come, give it up, and save further trouble.</p>

<p><i>Zeke.</i> Look here, State constables, I’m a peaceable
citizen. I’m also a plain-spoken individual. You’re a
couple of State constables? Where’s your uniform?
There’s nothing uniform about you, except your red noses,
which are pretty well matched. Look here! (<i>Takes off
his coat.</i>) That demijohn is under my protection. I’m
mighty ashamed of its company; but I’m bound to take
it home with me, if it don’t burn up on the way; and, if
you want it, come and take it. (<i>Backs up stage, squares
off, and shows fight.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Phil</i> (<i>coming forward</i>). We sha’n’t get it that way.</p>

<p><i>Ned.</i> No, sir. State constables won’t do. We can’t
take it. Ah! a lucky thought. There’s that little darkey
Chick playing by the water. Go push him in quick.</p>

<p><i>Phil.</i> What’s the joke?</p>

<p><i>Ned.</i> No matter, go and do it; and then come back

<p><i>Phil.</i> Ned, can you swim?</p>

<p><i>Ned.</i> Swim? not a stroke. What’s the matter?</p>

<p><i>Phil.</i> A little darkey has just fallen into the water
there. I tried to reach him with a pole, but failed; and I
mustn’t go into the water: my physician said it would be
the death of me.</p>

<p><i>Zeke.</i> You cursed fools! is that the way you chatter
when a fellow-creature is drowning? Where is he?</p>

<p><i>Ned.</i> Can you swim?</p>

<p><i>Zeke</i> (<i>throws off his coat</i>). Of course I can. Where
is he, I say?</p>

<p><i>Phil.</i> Right off there: you can see his head just going
under for the last time. Do save him!</p>

<p><i>Zeke.</i> I’ll save him if the wool holds. (<i>Exit <span class="smcap">Zeke</span>, <span class="smcapuc">L.</span></i>)</p>

<p><i>Phil.</i> And I’ll save your demijohn! (<i>Both Phil and
Ned rush together to the demijohn.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Phil.</i> Let’s take it home at once.</p>

<p><i>Ned.</i> Hold on, I must have a drop.</p>

<p><i>Phil.</i> Be quick, then; he’ll be back. Let me have the
first pull.</p>

<p><i>Ned.</i> No, no: that brilliant idea by which we obtained
it was mine.</p>

<p><i>Phil.</i> But I executed it, and nearly executed the
darkey at the same time.</p>

<p><i>Ned.</i> Well, well, hurry, hurry!</p>

<p><i>Phil.</i> Then here goes (<i>drinks and spits out</i>). Oh!
murder, what stuff! Do you suppose it is poison?</p>

<p><i>Phil.</i> Here goes (<i>drinks, and hands the demijohn to

(<i>drinks, and spits out</i>). Phew! concentrated essence of
all that is horrible! What stuff!</p>

<p><i>Zeke.</i> Where would you have gone to if I hadn’t
pulled you out?</p>

<p><i>Chick.</i> Donno Massa: spec I’d gone to Dixie.</p>

<p><i>Zeke.</i> Well, go and lay down there and dry yourself.</p>

<p>(<i>Chick goes back, and, during the next dialogue, manages

light it is! Those chaps have helped themselves while I
was pulling out the darkey. If they don’t have a convulsion
in their insides, then I’m a Dutchman. Here’s
a chance for a speculation. I’ll try the effects of a little
“moral suasion,” and see if I can’t add a couple of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>

<p><i>Festus.</i> “Thus far into the bowels of the land have
we marched on without impediment.” Here am I once
more in the place from which, but one short week ago, I
made an unceremonious exit as the rejected suitor of a
young, lovely, and talented lady. Rejected suitor!&mdash;those
words slip very smoothly from the lips, as pleasantly
as though they were associated with some high-sounding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
title of nobility. There is nothing in the
sound of them to conjure up the miserable, mean, contemptible,
kicked-out feeling which a man experiences
who has received at the hands of lovely woman that
specimen of feminine handicraft,&mdash;the mitten. All my
own fault too! I’m a bashful man. Modesty, the virtue
which is said to have been “the ruination of Ireland,”
is the rock against which my soaring ambition
has dashed itself. I have sat in this room, evening after
evening, upon the edge of a chair, twirling my thumbs,
and saying&mdash;nothing. I couldn’t help it. I have brought
scores of compliments to the door, and left them in the
hall with my hat. I wanted to speak; I kept up “a
deuse of a thinking;” but somehow, when I had an
agreeable speech ready to pop out of my mouth, it
seemed to be frightened at the sight of the fair object
against whom it was to be launched, and tumbled back
again. It’s no use: when a man is in love, the more he
loves, the more silent he becomes; at least it was so in
my case. And when I did manage, after much stammering
and blushing, to “pop the question,” the first word from
the lady set me shivering; and the conclusion of her
remarks set me running from the house utterly demoralized,&mdash;“I
shall always be happy to see you as a
<em>friend</em>, your conversation is so agreeable.” Here was
a damper, after six weeks of unremitting though <em>silent</em>
attention. But she likes me, I’m sure of that. It is
my silence which has frightened her. I only need a little
more variety in my style of conversation to make
myself agreeable to her. I have an original idea; and
I advise all bashful men to take warning from my past<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
experience, and profit by my future. I will <em>borrow</em> language
in which to speak my passion. There’s nothing
very original in borrowing, financially speaking; but to
borrow another man’s ideas by which to make love, I
call original. And, as luck would have it, I have an
excellent opportunity to test my new idea. Lounging
in the sanctum of my friend Quill, the editor of “The
Postscript,” a few days ago, he called my attention to an
advertisement which had just been presented for insertion.
It ran thus: “Wanted, a reader,&mdash;a gentleman who
has studied poetic and dramatic compositions with a
view to delivery, who has a good voice, and who would
be willing to give one evening a week to the entertaining
of an invalid. Address, with references, ‘Stella,’ Postscript
Office.” I recognized the handwriting as that of
the lady to whom I had been paying attentions, the signature
as the <i lang="fr">nom de plume</i> under which she had written
several poetic contributions for the press; and I had no
trouble in guessing the meaning of the advertisement,
knowing she has an invalid uncle. “There is a tide in
the affairs of men, which, taken at the flood, leads on
to fortune.” I felt that it was high tide with me, and
boldly launched my canoe; answered the advertisement
under the assumed name of “Festus,” and waited for
a reply. It came: “Stella is satisfied with the references
of Festus, and will give him an opportunity to test
his ability as a reader Tuesday evening next,”<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> &amp;c.
You will naturally conclude that my heart bounded
with rapture on receiving this favorable answer. It did
nothing of the sort: on the contrary, the <em>re</em>bound almost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
took away my breath. I began to shiver and shake, and
felt inclined to retreat. But “love conquers all things.”
I determined to persevere; and here I am, by appointment,
to test the practicability of my original idea. The
lady is a fine reader. I am well acquainted with her
favorite authors; and, if I can but interest her in this
novel suit, may at least pass a pleasant evening if I am
not unspeakably happy. I was told to wait for Stella.
(<i>Takes a book from table, and sits <span class="smcapuc">L.</span> of table, with his
back to <span class="smcapuc">R.</span></i>) Shakspeare, ah! Let me draw a little courage
from the perusal of this. (<i>Enter <span class="smcap">Stella</span>, <span class="smcapuc">R.</span>, in evening
costume, with flowers in her hair.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Stella.</i> My maid said Festus was in this room. Ah!
there he is, deep in a book: that’s so like these literary
gentry! No sooner are their roving eyes fastened on a
book than it is seized with the avidity with which a
starving man grasps a loaf of bread. He seems
happy: I will not disturb him. (<i>Sits on tête-à-tête.</i>)
What a strange idea! Here am I to pass the evening
listening to the voice of one whom I never saw before.
This is one of my uncle’s whims: he fears I am working
too hard to entertain him with readings from his
favorite authors, and so determines to employ a reader
to relieve me. Dear uncle, with all his pain and suffering
he has a sharp eye: he notices my want of spirit,
and thinks it is caused by weariness. He little knows that
the true cause is that stupid lover of mine, who sat here
evening after evening as dumb as an oyster, until, out of
spite, I started him off. What could have ailed the man?
Nothing could he say but “Yes, ma’am,” “No, ma’am,”
“Fine evening,” “Good-night.” I never was so plagued<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
in all my life, for I should have liked the fellow if he
had only tried to make himself agreeable; but he was
as silent and stupid as&mdash;Festus here. (<i><span class="smcap">Festus</span> rises,
gesticulating with his hand, his eyes fastened on the book.</i>)
What can the man be about?</p>

<p><i>Festus.</i> (<i>Reading.</i>) “Is this a dagger which I see
before me? the handle towards my hand? Come, let me
clutch thee! I have thee not, and yet I see”&mdash; (<i>Turns
and sees <span class="smcap">Stella</span>. Drops book, and runs behind chair very
confused.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Stella.</i> Good gracious! you here again?</p>

<p><i>Festus.</i> I beg your pardon. You are&mdash;I am&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Stella.</i> I thought, sir, I was to have no more of your
agreeable society.</p>

<p><i>Festus.</i> I beg your pardon, madam: you seem to be
in error. I am Festus,&mdash;Festus.</p>

<p><i>Stella.</i> You Festus?</p>

<p><i>Festus.</i> Oh, yes: I’m Festus! I came here by appointment.</p>

<p><i>Stella.</i> What do you mean, sir? I expected a gentleman
here to read.</p>

<p><i>Festus.</i> Exactly! Pray, are you the invalid?</p>

<p><i>Stella.</i> Sir, you are insulting! You will be kind
enough to leave this room at once. I thought the last
time you were here&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Festus.</i> Excuse me for interrupting; but you evidently
mistake me for some other person. I never was
in this house before.</p>

<p><i>Stella.</i> Is the man crazy? Do you mean to say you
did not make a proposal of marriage to me in this very
room a week ago?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Festus.</i> Madam, you surprise me. To the best of
my knowledge and belief, I never saw you before.</p>

<p><i>Stella.</i> Was there ever such assurance? Is not your
name&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Festus.</i> Festus; and yours Stella. Am I not right?</p>

<p><i>Stella.</i> Sir, this is very provoking; but, if you are
Festus, what is your object in calling here?</p>

<p><i>Festus.</i> To entertain you.</p>

<p><i>Stella.</i> To entertain me! With what, pray? Sitting
on the edge of a chair, and twirling your thumbs?</p>

<p><i>Festus.</i> (<i>Aside.</i>) That’s a hard hit. (<i>Aloud.</i>) With
readings, if you please.</p>

<p><i>Stella.</i> Readings! Pray, what do you read? Ovid’s
“Art of Love”?</p>

<p><i>Festus.</i> Madam, I answered your advertisement, being
desirous of securing the situation of reader to an invalid.</p>

<p><i>Stella.</i> You won’t suit.</p>

<p><i>Festus.</i> You haven’t heard me.</p>

<p><i>Stella.</i> No, but I’ve seen you; and your silence cannot
be excelled by your reading.</p>

<p><i>Festus.</i> Will you hear me read?</p>

<p><i>Stella.</i> No: you will not suit.</p>

<p><i>Festus.</i> Very well: then I <em>claim</em> the trial. Remember
your promise,&mdash;“Stella is satisfied with the references
of ‘Festus,’ and will give him an opportunity to test his
ability as a reader Tuesday evening,” &amp;c., &amp;c.</p>

<p><i>Stella.</i> Oh, very well! If you insist upon making
yourself ridiculous, proceed. (<i>Sits in chair, <span class="smcapuc">R.</span> of table,
and turns her back on <span class="smcap">Festus</span>.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Festus.</i> But will you not listen to me? I cannot read
to you while you sit in that position.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Stella.</i> I told you I did not wish to hear you read:
you insist. Proceed: I am not interested.</p>

<p><i>Festus.</i> Oh, very well! My first selection shall be
from the writings of one well known to fame,&mdash;a lady
whose compositions have electrified the world; whose
poetic effusions have lulled to sleep the cross and peevish
infant, stilled the noisy nursery, and exerted an influence
upon mankind of great and lasting power; one whose
works are memorable for their antiquity,&mdash;the gift of
genius to the budding greatness of the nineteenth century.

<p><i>Stella.</i> Sir, you have forced yourself here, an unwelcome
visitor: you insist upon my hearing such nonsense
as Mother-Goose melodies for an hour. Do you call
that gentlemanly?</p>

<p><i>Festus.</i> Madam, you advertised for a reader. I have
applied, with your permission, for the situation. Under
the circumstances, I naturally expected to have your
attention during the reading of such selections as I should
offer; instead of which, you turn your back upon me,
and very coolly bid me proceed. Do <em>you</em> call that
ladylike?</p>

<p><i>Stella.</i> Frankly, no. You have asked the trial: you
shall have it. For an hour I will hear you; and, though
I strongly suspect the situation of reader is not the object
of your visit, you shall have no reason to complain of
my inattention. Is that satisfactory?</p>

<p><i>Festus.</i> Pray go a step farther. You are said to have
fine elocutionary powers. May I not hope to have the
pleasure of hearing your voice? Grant me your assistance,

<p><i>Stella.</i> That is very amusing; but, Mr. Festus, if
this is the extent of your elocutionary acquirements&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Festus.</i> Oh, I beg your pardon! By no means! With
your permission, I will read something a little more
sombre,&mdash;Edgar Poe’s “Raven.”</p>

<p><i>Stella.</i> That is certainly more sombre. Proceed.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Reading. “The Raven,” by Edgar A. Poe. <span class="smcap">Festus.</span></i></p>

<p><i>Stella.</i> Excellent! Mr. Festus, you are certainly a

<p><i>Festus.</i> It does, it does; for I, too, have lost one&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Stella.</i> A raven?</p>

<p><i>Stella.</i> How?</p>

<p><i>Festus.</i> When I think “it might have been.”</p>

<p><i>Stella.</i> Then I wouldn’t think of it, if I were you.
What shall we have now?</p>

<p><i>Festus.</i> Suppose we read together.</p>

<p><i>Stella.</i> Together?</p>

<p><i>Festus.</i> Yes, a scene from some play. There’s “The
Marble Heart.”</p>

<p><i>Stella.</i> Oh, there’s nothing in that but love-scenes!</p>

<p><i>Festus.</i> It’s a favorite play with me; and I have been
thinking, while you were reading, that the character of
“Marco” is one in which you might excel.</p>

<p><i>Stella.</i> Indeed! I have studied the character.</p>

<p><i>Festus.</i> (<i>Aside.</i>) I should think so. (<i>Aloud.</i>) Let
us attempt a scene. Come, you shall have your choice.</p>

<p><i>Stella.</i> Thank you. Then I will choose “the rejection
scene.”</p>

<p><i>Festus.</i> (<i>Aside.</i>) Of course you would! (<i>Aloud.</i>)
Very well.</p>

<p><i>Stella.</i> Do you know, Mr. Festus, I think there is
something very odd in your attempting a love-scene?</p>

<p><i>Festus.</i> Do you? I have attempted them, and with
success too.</p>

<p><i>Stella.</i> Ah! I remember there was one attempted here.</p>

<p><i>Festus.</i> Indeed!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Stella.</i> Yes; but the gentleman’s name was not Festus.</p>

<p><i>Festus.</i> Fail! “In the bright lexicon of youth,

<p><i>Raph.</i> I have endured the sarcasms of Monsieur de Veaudore,
the disavowal of your love, the reproaches and anger of my only
friend, who insulted me in my last adieu: for your sake, I have
become a coward, a crawling, abject wretch, without heart, without
mind, without shame. (<i>Throws himself into chair, <span class="smcapuc">L.</span>, and covers his

<span class="smcap">Raphael</span> raises his head, looks at her, and endeavors to speak with
firmness.</i>) What did that man say to you? I have a right to ask.</p>

<p><i>Marco.</i> (<i>Smiling in derision.</i>) Right!</p>

<p><i>Raph.</i> Yes, Marco, the right of a man, who, knowing he is to
die, would learn the time and manner of his death. He told you
he loved you?</p>

<p><i>Marco.</i> (<i>Carelessly.</i>) Perhaps he did: what then?</p>

<p><i>Raph.</i> (<i>Violently.</i>) You accepted his love?</p>

<p><i>Marco.</i> I will not answer you.</p>

<p><i>Raph.</i> But you must, you shall!</p>

<p><i>Marco.</i> (<i>Disdainfully.</i>) Shall!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Raph.</i> He offered you his hand? (<i>A pause.</i>) Speak, Marco,
speak: in mercy let me know the worst.</p>

<p><i>Marco.</i> He did.</p>

<p><i>Raph.</i> And you accepted?</p>

<p><i>Marco.</i> (<i>Coldly.</i>) Yes.</p>

<p><i>Raph.</i> (<i>Greatly agitated.</i>) O Marco, Marco! (<i>Violently, rising.</i>)
You shall not marry him!</p>

<p><i>Marco.</i> (<i>With contempt.</i>) Who shall prevent me?</p>

<p><i>Raph.</i> (<i>With a burst of fury.</i>) The man you have wronged!
(<i>Suddenly losing all command over himself, and throwing himself at
her feet in an agony of grief.</i>) No, no! Pity, pity for the wretched
maniac who cannot live without you&mdash;humanity&mdash;remorse&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Marco.</i> (<i>Taking away her hand, and rising, with contempt and rage.</i>)
Remorse! I am weary of this persecution, these clamors, these
maledictions. You think me a monster of falsehood, inconstant as
the wind, perfidious as the ocean, the incarnation of caprice, selfishness,
and cruelty? And why? Because I am too wise to rush headlong
to ruin, and too proud to be pitied.</p>

<p><i>Raph.</i> Pitied, Marco!</p>

<p><i>Marco.</i> Yes (<i>vehemently</i>), pitied, insulted, and despised. Look
at me now, surrounded with every luxury that art can invent and
gold can purchase. Everybody bows to me. I am a queen. Divest
me of these gilded claims to the world’s respect, and what am I?
(<i>Bitterly.</i>) The dust&mdash;the friends who now follow my carriage, and
fight for my smiles, will mock me, spurn me, and trample upon me.</p>

<p><i>Raph.</i> Marco, Marco! in mercy&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Marco.</i> I have known poverty, and have suffered such tortures
in its hideous grasp that my heart sickens and my soul shudders at
facing it again. You will perhaps laugh at my fear, and say there
is happiness in poverty. (<i>Laughing in scorn.</i>) Yes, for those who
are born to it; but to have known better days, and fall! Oh the
misery, the heart-desolation, the despair! My father was rich and
proud, the descendant of a noble family. He lived in splendor, and
brought me up to despise every thing but wealth. He showed me
its power: it surrounded him with friends and flatterers, and made
life a perpetual summer. An evil day arrived: he speculated, and
was reduced to his last crown. Where were his friends? (<i>Laughing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
in scorn, and speaking in a hoarse voice.</i>) They passed him in the
street without recognition, they maligned, they despised, they forgot
him. (<i>Sinks into a chair, sobbing, and wiping her eyes.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Raph.</i> Forbear, Marco, forbear!</p>

<p><i>Marco.</i> Ten years (oh, how long the days and months!) we lived
in poverty,&mdash;abject, squalid, starving poverty. I saw my father in
the prime of his life grow old, decrepit, and insane. In his ravings
he had but one thought, “Money, money, money!” “Cling to
it, my child,” he would say to me with glaring eyes and grinding
teeth,&mdash;“cling to it, Marco, as you would to a raft in shipwreck: it
is the all in all of our existence. See what the loss of it has brought
to me. Let your heart be marble to <em>every thing</em> but gold, gold,
gold!”</p>

<p><i>Raph.</i> O misery!</p>

<p><i>Marco.</i> My father died, and I was left dependent on the charity
of my relations. (<i>With savage scorn.</i>) Charity! I wore their cast
clothes, waited on their will,&mdash;their servant, their encumbrance,
their hopeless slave. One happy day, Providence came to my relief:
I was left a small fortune. (<i>Rising.</i>) From that moment I
became a statue. The recollection of my days of misery extinguished
the glowing impulses of my youth; and I lived on the surface of the
world, mixing in all its gay pleasures, caressed and <em>fêted</em>, the idol
of the hour, hating and despising the smiling monster, and devising
means to secure my independence. A wealthy marriage was
the only course; and for that I have devoted myself, heart and
mind; for that I have been cruel, false, and pitiless; for that I
am deaf to reproaches, dead to remorse. (<i>Sits.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Raph.</i> (<i>In amazement.</i>) I hear you, Marco, and disbelieve my
ears: I see you, and doubt my eyes. Those fearful words, those evil
looks,&mdash;is it possible such hideousness can dwell in such a heavenly
shrine? (<i>Growing gradually frantic.</i>) But I am glad, very glad,
you have at last been candid with me: it relieves me from a world
of sorrow, it rescues me from despair. Yet I hoped you had some
regard for me, some little regret for&mdash;Ah, well! it was my accursed
vanity. How could I ever hope to?&mdash; (<i>Laughing hysterically,
and speaking in a hoarse whisper.</i>) I, too, am a deception: I
have pretended to devote to you my heart, my life, my soul&mdash;no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
such thing! I, too, wore a mask&mdash;ha, ha, ha! When my eyes
looked fondest, my heart was plotting treachery; when I swore you
were my happiness, I felt you were my curse; when I vowed I
could not live without you, I was devising means to break with
you&mdash;ha, ha, ha! We owe each other nothing; we are both demons:
but the comedy is over now, and the actors have returned
to their every-day costumes and natures. I wish to be a gentleman,
like Monsieur Veaudore. Mademoiselle Marco, I ask pardon
for having annoyed you so long. I leave you to your pleasures.
(<i>He endeavors to kiss her hand; but she recoils, alarmed by the wildness
of his tone and looks.</i>) What do you fear? (<i>With a burst of maniac
laughter.</i>) There is no venom on my lips: it is in my heart!
(<i>Kisses her hand.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Marco.</i> (<i>Alarmed, trying to pacify him.</i>) Come, come, Raphael,
let us be friends.</p>

<p><i>Raph.</i> (<i>With a vacant stare.</i>) Friends!&mdash;oh, yes! delighted!
(<i>Bowing with cold politeness, in the manner of his first introduction.</i>)
Mademoiselle Marco, I believe&mdash;beautiful, very beautiful, but
(<i>shaking his head mournfully</i>) false, false, fatally false. (<i>Sighing, and
putting his hand to his head.</i>) Ah, yes! and now we are friends
(<i>shaking both her hands, and looking at her earnestly</i>),&mdash;yes, yes,
real friends; for we no longer love, no longer deceive each other.</p>

<p><i>Marco.</i> Raphael!</p>

<p><i>Raph.</i> We thought we were happy. (<i>Laughing.</i>) Vain delusion!
we were breaking our hearts. (<i>With a sudden alteration of
tone and countenance conveying that the recollection of his home had
suddenly come to his mind.</i>) Yes, yes (<i>with a tremulous voice</i>),

<p><i>Marco.</i> You will call and see me sometimes in Paris?</p>

<p><i>Raph.</i> (<i>Gayly bowing with affected politeness.</i>) You are very
kind; but I fear I shall not often be able to profit by your politeness,
for my work&mdash;you understand&mdash;it is necessary that I should repair
the time I have lost; and besides, when I and the persons who
reside with me have recovered our happiness, it would be indiscreet
to revive recollections that might jeopardize it.</p>

<p><i>Raph.</i> (<i>With scorn.</i>) No, no (<i>with a maniac smile</i>): I shall

<p><i>Marco.</i> (<i>Rising from sofa, and looking after him with deep emotion.</i>)
O Raphael, Raphael! my heart is not quite marble; no, no, not
quite! (<i>Falls back on sofa, covers her face with her handkerchief, and
weeps.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Re-enter <span class="smcap">Raphael</span>.</i></p>

<p><i>Marco.</i> (<i>With a smile, holding out her hand.</i>) Thank you for

(<i>Trying to draw him to her.</i>) Yes, yes: I see you do; and you will
pardon me! (<i>She is about to put her arm round his neck: he looks

<p><i>Raph.</i> (<i>Sternly.</i>) Give it me! (<i><span class="smcap">Marco</span> gives it him.</i>) Don’t be

<p><i>Marco.</i> Raphael!</p>

<p><i>Raph.</i> Marco, shall I tell you why for a moment you have love<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
on your lips and in your eyes? ’Tis because you have learned that
in recalling me you could break another heart: the feeling which
guided you was not the happiness of Raphael, but the despair of
Marie. (<i><span class="smcap">Marco</span> starts.</i>) Now, adieu. But first give me your
wreath.</p>

<p><i>Marco.</i> My wreath?</p>

<p><i>Raph.</i> (<i>Approaching.</i>) I would have it.</p>

<p><i>Marco.</i> (<i>Recoiling alarmed.</i>) Are you mad?</p>

<p><i>Raph.</i> (<i>Wildly.</i>) Take it off, take it off! White roses are the
symbols of purity; they make <em>you</em> hideous: they are only for the
brows of innocence and truth. (<i>Tears the crown from her head, and

<p><i>Festus.</i> It is astonishing how much a little borrowed
plumage becomes a bashful man. The ice once broken
by the inspiring thoughts and words of the love-sick
“Raphael,” I feel now almost equal to the composition and
delivery of an energetic and passionate appeal that shall
carry the heart of the lady by storm; but then, having
once been refused, I dread a second attempt. “A burnt
child fears the fire;” and a singed lover trembles before
the blazing eyes of the object of his adoration. I have
yet a short time before the expiration of my hour of trial,
and the character of “Sir Thomas Clifford” from which
to borrow courage. (<i>Enter <span class="smcap">Stella</span>, <span class="smcapuc">C.</span></i>)</p>

<p><i>Festus.</i> Madam, to tell you the truth, I was&mdash;thinking&mdash;of
you.</p>

<p><i>Stella.</i> Of me, or of your future salary?</p>

<p><i>Festus.</i> Both.</p>

<p><i>Stella.</i> Well, what am I?</p>

<p><i>Festus.</i> (<i>Abruptly.</i>) A very fine reader.</p>

<p><i>Stella.</i> Oh! is that all?</p>

<p><i>Festus.</i> All worth mentioning.</p>

<p><i>Stella.</i> Sir!</p>

<p><i>Festus.</i> That is all I am at liberty to mention.</p>

what shall I read?</p>

<p><i>Festus.</i> Oh! oblige me by making your own selection.</p>

<p><i>Stella.</i> There’s “The Bells,” by Poe. Do you like
that?</p>

<p><i>Festus.</i> Oh, exceedingly!</p>

<p><i>Stella.</i> But I don’t know how to read it: it’s very
difficult.</p>

<p><i>Festus.</i> Perhaps I can assist you. (<i>Aside.</i>) I’ll provoke
her a bit; see if she has a temper.</p>

<p><i>Stella.</i> Well, you are very kind. (<i>Aside.</i>) I’ll see
if I can make him talk.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Festus.</i> Well, then, you take the book, and read.
(<i>Hands her copy of Poe.</i>) When I think you need correcting,
I will speak.</p>

<p><i>Stella.</i> Very well. (<i>They sit, <span class="smcapuc">C.</span> <span class="smcap">Stella</span> reads in a

<p class="scene"><span class="smcap">Scene.</span>&mdash;<i>Room No. 86,“Fatted Calf” Hotel. Table
and two chairs, <span class="smcapuc">C.</span> Entrances, <span class="smcapuc">R.</span> and <span class="smcapuc">L.</span></i></p>

<p><i>Hanscomb</i> (<i>outside, <span class="smcapuc">L.</span></i>). Steve, Pete, come, come,
hurry, hurry, wake up! (<i>Enter, <span class="smcapuc">L.</span></i>) This is really encouraging.
The Fatted Calf, just opened, is rapidly
filling up, and such customers, too; real upper crust,&mdash;nabobs,
millionnaires, heiresses, generals, majors, captains,
colonels, and all sorts of stylish people! Now
let’s look at the situation. I have on my books already
thirty permanent boarders at five dollars a day. Pretty
high for the times, but that draws the style. Of these
thirty, ten will pay up promptly, ten wont pay at all,
and the other ten will be obliged to leave their baggage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
to settle the bill. Well, I think that will pay. We
must give a wide margin for profit, and in course of
time may make a fortune, or manage to fail for seventy-five
or a hundred thousand, either of which will create a
sensation. Where can those waiters be? Ah, here’s
Steve at last, as stiff and pompous as one of the nabobs
whom he delights to wait upon. (<i>Enter Steve, <span class="smcapuc">L.</span></i>)</p>

<p><i>Steve.</i> Mr. Hanscomb, allow me to present for your
inspection this document just left at the bar, with the
compliments of the landlord of the Hotel Bullock.
(<i>Gives Hanscomb printed handbill.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Mr. H.</i> What is it? (<i>Reads.</i>) “Stop, thief! Nab
him! Strayed from the Hotel Bullock an individual
passing by the singular name of John Smith.” John
Smith? I think I’ve heard that name before.</p>

<p><i>Steve.</i> It has a very <i lang="fr">distangue</i> air.</p>

<p><i>Mr. H.</i> “Tall, red hair, pale, ferocious-looking countenance;
wore, when last seen, dark mixed pants, blue
coat with brass buttons, white hat, and a shawl. A reward
of one cent will be given for the arrest of the missing
individual, and fifty dollars for the recovery of one
dozen silver spoons, which said individual, probably accidentally,
took with him.” So, so, a hotel thief. Mr.
John Smith will no doubt pay me a visit; so, Steve,
just keep a sharp look-out for this spoony. (<i>Enter
Pete, <span class="smcapuc">R.</span>, muttering and shaking his head.</i>) Well,
what’s the matter with you?</p>

<p><i>Pete.</i> Mr. Hanscomb, I don’t wish to be <em>troubulous</em>,&mdash;I
don’t wish to be <em>troubulous</em>, Mr. Hanscomb, but dar are
t’ings, Mr. Hanscomb, dat stir de heart of man, as Deacon
Foster eloquentially distresses himself, and&mdash;and&mdash;and&mdash;well,

<p><i>Mr. H.</i> What’s the matter, stupid?</p>

<p><i>Pete.</i> Mr. Hanscomb, you’re my massa.</p>

<p><i>Mr. H.</i> Well, well?</p>

<p><i>Pete.</i> You’re my massa, Mr. Hanscomb, and I s’pose
you can call me what you please.</p>

<p><i>Mr. H.</i> Of course I can.</p>

<p><i>Pete.</i> Ob course, ob course, kase I look upon you as
my equel.</p>

<p><i>Mr. H.</i> Well, I’m much obliged&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Pete.</i> Don’t apologize; no matter ’bout nuffin; but
dat ar hostler down dar, he’s an ignoramus, down dar,
he is, down dar; he’s low and insultin’, he is. By golly!
de imperance of dat feller is distressin’. He says I’m
bound to <em>asswociate</em> wid him kase he’s a man and a brudder.
Guess not, Mr. Hanscomb,&mdash;guess not; don’t
asswociate wid people dat smell ob de stable.</p>

<p><i>Mr. H.</i> You attend to your business, and he shall
not trouble you.</p>

<p><i>Pete.</i> Dat’s all I ask, Mr. Hanscomb,&mdash;dat’s all I
ask. Jes’ you keep hisself to hisself, and I wont say
nuffin. I’s perfectly dissatisfied, but if he jes’ trubble
me, I’ll brush him off&mdash;brush him off.</p>

<p><i>Mr. H.</i> Well, well, you go about your business.</p>

<p><i>Steve</i> (<i>at door, <span class="smcapuc">L.</span>, looking off</i>). Here’s a queer-looking
customer, and I’m not sure but what it is our friend,
John Smith, of the spoon adventure; just the dress,
even to the shawl.</p>

<p><i>Mr. H.</i> Ah, so soon? Now, boys, look sharp and
catch him in the act,&mdash;in the act, mind. (<i>Exit, <span class="smcapuc">L.</span>
Pete about to follow.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Steve.</i> Where are you going, Pete?</p>

<p><i>Pete.</i> Going? Going after de axe, ob course.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Steve.</i> After the axe! What do you want of the axe?</p>

<p><i>Pete.</i> Cotch dat ar spoon feller. Didn’t massa say
be sure and cotch him wid de axe?</p>

<p><i>Steve.</i> Well, you <em>are</em> an ignoramus.</p>

<p><i>Sam</i> (<i>outside, <span class="smcapuc">L.</span>, in Cockney dialect</i>). Up this way,
eh? Oh! never mind, Mister, I’ll find the way. First
turn to the right, second to the left, and then keep
straight on, and here you are. (<i>Enter, <span class="smcapuc">L.</span></i>) So this is
eighty-six, first floor from the roof. It’s airy, anyhow.
(<i>Steve, <span class="smcapuc">L.</span>, Pete, <span class="smcapuc">R.</span>, step up each side of Sam with
the exclamation, “Take your baggage!” One seizes umbrella,
the other carpet-bag, and start for entrances, <span class="smcapuc">R.</span>
and <span class="smcapuc">L.</span></i>) Here, you African, bring back that umbrella,
and you, Mr. Upstart, bring back that valise. I
choose to have them under my own observation.</p>

<p><i>Pete.</i> Don’t you want your wardrobe aired?</p>

<p><i>Sam.</i> No, I don’t want it aired. What’s your name,
African?</p>

<p><i>Pete.</i> My name, massa, am White; dey calls me
Pete.</p>

<p><i>Sam.</i> And what’s your name, Upstart?</p>

<p><i>Steve.</i> My name is Black; I am called here Stephen.</p>

<p><i>Pete.</i> “Steben, Steben; don’t you bleeb ’im.” He’s
called Steeb, short Steeb.</p>

<p><i>Sam.</i> Well, you cut short, African, and cut off. Do
you see that entrance? Well, you both get outside
that entrance instantly. (<i>Steve and Pete go to entrance,
<span class="smcapuc">L.</span></i>)</p>

<p><i>Steve.</i> Pete, that is John Smith.</p>

<p><i>Pete.</i> No! De spoon feller?</p>

<p><i>Steve.</i> The same. Don’t you see the pants and the
coat and the shawl? ’Tis the pettifogger.</p>

<p><i>Pete.</i> Petti who? I fought it was Smiff,&mdash;John Smiff.</p>

<p><i>Sam</i> (<i>during this speech busies himself taking off
his shawl, brushing his clothes, smoothing his hair, etc.</i>).
What ails them objects? They look at me awful
hard; they are evidently not accustomed to the presence
of so elegant an individual in this hotel. So
this is an hotel; this is the first time that ever I was
in one. I declare, it’s quite elegant. And this is
Boston, the hub of the universe, as Artemus Ward
says. I wonder I have ever lived to get here, after
having been cooped up in that horrid hole, Dismaltown.
It is refreshing to get among civilized individuals.
I’ve passed my whole life in that place without ever
seeing anybody or anything, and I should be there
now but for my uncle, the captain; and somehow I
do feel quite homesick when I think of my Annastasia;
but then my Annastasia is not there; she is nearer to
me in Boston than in Dismaltown, for my Annastasia
is now on a visit to her aunt in Brighton. I have received
epistles often from the object of my heart’s adoration,
and the last one was particularly interesting.
She invited me in the name of her aunt to come and
spend Christmas with her. I was particularly overjoyed
at first, but how was I to get there? The people
of Dismaltown never go anywhere, and I should
never have got here but for my uncle, the captain. My
uncle has always been called captain, though he never
went to sea, but for years has been behind the counter
of the little grocery at Dismaltown, where he made some
money. Well, my uncle took it into his head to buy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
a sloop; so he bought a sloop; it was a very good
sloop for a second-hand one. The sloop was well sold,
and so, they said, was my uncle, the captain. My
uncle bought her, and then was bent on going a voyage
in her as skipper, and so he invited me to go with
him on his first voyage to Boston. He never went to sea
before, and don’t know anything about a sloop, and he
was awful sick all the way, but he had a good mate, and
he is a beautiful skipper; he talks such sea lingo, and
swears so beautifully, though people do say that he
knows no more about the sea than an owl; but that
is all envy. Well, after I got aboard, I happened to
think of one sentence in Annastasia’s letter, which
read, “Be sure to learn how to carve before you come,
as uncle is away, and aunt will expect you to
carve the Christmas goose.” What an idea! they
might as well ask me to carve an ox or an alligator.
However, when I reached Boston, I bought a
little book on the art of carving, and came up to this
hotel to have a little practice. Look here, African.
(<i>Pete and Steve have been bobbing in and out of the door,
<span class="smcapuc">L.</span>, during the speech, watching Sam. Enter Pete, <span class="smcapuc">L.</span></i>)
Do you know what a goose is?</p>

<p><i>Pete.</i> Yes, massa; one ob dem two-legged fellers dat
flops his wings jes’ so&mdash;dis way&mdash;so.</p>

<p><i>Sam.</i> Well, I want one of them.</p>

<p><i>Pete.</i> One ob dem flappers? Live one?</p>

<p><i>Sam.</i> No, ignorance,&mdash;roasted.</p>

<p><i>Pete.</i> Yes, massa. (<i>Calls, <span class="smcapuc">L.</span></i>) Roast goose for 86.</p>

<p><i>Sam.</i> No, no, stupid! Not for eighty-six; I only
want it for one.</p>

<p><i>Pete.</i> It’s all right, massa; dat’s what I fought,&mdash;dat’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
what I fought. Dar wont but one goose come
up here, so decompose yourself,&mdash;decompose yourself.
(<i>Exit, <span class="smcapuc">L.</span></i>)</p>

<p><i>Sam.</i> What horrid grammar that African does indulge
in! (<i>Capt. Skillings outside&mdash;“Ship ahoy!
ahoy!” through speaking-trumpet.</i>) There’s my uncle,
the captain. (<i>Enter Captain, <span class="smcapuc">L.</span></i>)</p>

<p><i>Capt.</i> Shiver my timbers, blast my eyes, and keel-haul
<em>me</em>, if this here craft ar’n’t the biggest seventy-four
that ever I saw in all my cruisings. Such a climbing
up hatchways and over bulkheads is trying to the
narves of a tar with his sea-legs on.</p>

<p><i>Sam</i> (<i>aside</i>). Now, isn’t that beautiful language?
It sounds so briny! (<i>Aloud.</i>) But I say, uncle, where’s
your tar?</p>

<p><i>Capt.</i> Blast my eyes! Shiver my timbers! Do you
mean to insult me? Aint I the skipper of the “Jemima
Matilda,” as stanch a craft as ever sailed out of harbor,
with spanker jib-boom hauled taut, and foretop main-truck
flying at the mast-head?</p>

<p><i>Sam</i> (<i>enthusiastically</i>). Oh, aint he a spanker?</p>

<p><i>Capt.</i> Now, look here, nevy, none of your jokes, or,
shiver my timbers, I’ll disinherit you. Aint I the skipper
of the “Jemima”&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Sam.</i> Oh, uncle, you said that before.</p>

<p><i>Capt.</i> Blast my eyes, I’ll say it again. (<i>Enter
Steve, <span class="smcapuc">L.</span></i>) Look here, messmate, I’m a sailor; not one
of your fresh-water sailors, but a regular-built old sea-dog.</p>

<p><i>Sam</i> (<i>aside</i>). Eight days old; hasn’t got his eyes
open yet.</p>

<p><i>Capt.</i> I’ve climbed the rigging in the darkest night.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Sam</i> (<i>aside</i>). So dark nobody could see him.</p>

<p><i>Capt.</i> I’ve seen the waves roll mountains high.</p>

<p><i>Sam</i> (<i>aside</i>). That’s a great idea.</p>

<p><i>Capt.</i> I’ve been alone in the middle of the ocean in
a jolly-boat.</p>

<p><i>Sam</i> (<i>aside</i>). That’s a jolly lie.</p>

<p><i>Steve.</i> Well, captain, what can I do for you?</p>

<p><i>Capt.</i> I say, messmate, did you ever hear of the escape
of the “Jemima Matilda” on her trip from Dismaltown
to Puddock?</p>

<p><i>Steve.</i> Never did.</p>

<p><i>Capt.</i> Then, blast my eyes, but you shall now, messmate.</p>

<p><i>Sam.</i> I say, uncle, don’t tell that horrid fiction
again.</p>

<p><i>Capt.</i> Fiction! You young dog, I’ll have you court-martialed.
(<i>Steve takes out tobacco-box and takes a
chew.</i>) Well, you must know, messmate&mdash;What you
got there?</p>

<p><i>Steve.</i> Tobacco; will you have a chew?</p>

<p><i>Capt.</i> No, I thank you; I don’t chew.</p>

<p><i>Steve.</i> You don’t? Well you are the first sailor I
ever saw who didn’t chew.</p>

<p><i>Capt.</i> I say, messmate, give us a chew. (<i>Aside.</i>)
If sailors chew this, I can.</p>

<p><i>Sam.</i> Don’t, uncle, don’t chew that horrid stuff; it’ll
make you as sick as a horse.</p>

<p><i>Capt.</i> Shiver my timbers, nevy, what’s the use in
being a sailor, if you don’t do as sailors do? Give us
another chew, messmate. Thank ye. You must know,
messmate, that the “Jemima Matilda,” of which I am<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
the skipper, left the harbor of Dismaltown on the second
of July for a trip to Puddock.</p>

<p><i>Sam.</i> With a cargo of onions.</p>

<p><i>Capt.</i> We hauled off from the wharf wing and wing.</p>

<p><i>Sam</i> (<i>aside</i>). It takes a pretty good sailor to put a
sloop wing and wing.</p>

<p><i>Capt.</i> As the wind freshened, we put more sail on
the mizzenmast, and took a reef in the capstan, and set
a hen-coop on top of the caboose, as a look-out. Then
came on a perfect hurricane. We were within the latitude
of forty-two degrees below zero, when I went below
to take an observation. I hadn’t been gone long
before there was a cry from the look-out of “There she
blows!” I rushed on deck, and sure enough it did blow
strong from the nor-nor-east, nor-east-by-nor, and the
ship was nearly on her bulkheads. The crew clung
around me and entreated me to save the ship. I alone
was calm. I had all the heavy furniture of my cabin,
consisting of a pine table, a musquito netting, and a
looking-glass, brought up and consigned to the waves;
but all in vain. Desperation nerved my arm, and seizing
a hatchet, I rushed abaft the hen-coop, and with one
terrific blow cut away&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Steve.</i> The mast!</p>

<p><i>Capt.</i> No, three feet of the cook’s stove-pipe. But
she righted, and we were saved. Then a new danger
arose on our weather bow. Three fathoms to windward
arose a rock with a shelving surface nearest us even
with the water, but the farthest part rising four feet.
We were in danger of striking, when I rushed to the
helm, bore hard on the compass, doused the binnacle
lights, and steered straight for the rock. Fortune favored<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
the bold manœuvre, for a sudden squall from the sou-sou-west
raised the ship upon the rock. She slid swiftly
over, and came down into the water with such a shock
that, blast my eyes, if all the salt junk in the caboose
didn’t turn of its own accord. Give us another chew,
messmate.</p>

<p><i>Sam</i> (<i>aside</i>). If my uncle aint a sailor, it isn’t for
want of ability to lie.</p>

<p><i>Steve.</i> Captain, is there anything I can do for you?</p>

<p><i>Capt.</i> Ay, ay, messmate; show me a room, and give
me something comfortable.</p>

<p><i>Steve.</i> Ay, ay, sir! A warm room and a good pipe.</p>

<p><i>Capt.</i> Pipe! Blast my eyes, I don’t smoke!</p>

<p><i>Steve.</i> You are the first sailor that ever I saw who
didn’t smoke.</p>

<p><i>Capt.</i> Oh, shiver my timbers, let’s have the pipe!</p>

<p><i>Sam.</i> I say, uncle, don’t smoke a horrid pipe; you’ll
be awful sick.</p>

<p><i>Capt.</i> Blast my eyes, nevy, do you take me for a
land-lubber? You just keep a sharp look-out here on
the quarter-deck, while I turn in and take a shot in the
locker. Heave ahead, my hearty (<i>to Steve</i>), or, shiver
my timbers, I’ll rake you fore and aft. (<i>Exit Steve and
Captain, <span class="smcapuc">L.</span></i>)</p>

<p><i>Sam.</i> My uncle knows a thing or two, but I’m
afraid that, with smoking and chewing, he’ll get awful
sick of this sailor business. Ah, here comes my goose.
(<i>Enter Steve and Pete, <span class="smcapuc">L.</span>, with table-cloth, dishes, and
a roast goose. They spread the cloth on table, <span class="smcapuc">C.</span>, and
arrange dishes.</i>) What an elegant spread!</p>

<p><i>Pete.</i> Anything else, massa?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Sam.</i> Let me see: there’s no ale; bring me some
ale; and&mdash;why, there’s no spoons!</p>

<p><i>Steve.</i> Spoons?</p>

<p><i>Pete.</i> Spo-spo-spo-spoons?</p>

<p><i>Sam.</i> Yes, spoons. How do you suppose an individual
is to eat without spoons?</p>

<p><i>Steve.</i> I’ll bring them, sir. (<i>Exit, <span class="smcapuc">L.</span></i>)</p>

<p><i>Sam.</i> Well, African, what are you grinning at?</p>

<p><i>Pete.</i> At de goose, massa,&mdash;at de goose. (<i>Enter
Steve, <span class="smcapuc">L.</span>, with spoons.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Sam.</i> Now leave. Get out. (<i>Steve and Pete come
down.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Steve.</i> Keep your eye on the spoons.</p>

<p><i>Pete.</i> By golly, Steve, if he take de spoons, he must
take African too. (<i>Exit Pete, <span class="smcapuc">R.</span>, Steve, <span class="smcapuc">L.</span></i>)</p>

<p><i>Sam.</i> It seems to me that those individuals have a
great deal of anxiety on my account. Well, now to business.
Where’s my “Art of Carving”? (<i>Pulls small book
from his pocket.</i>) Now let me see. No. 1 is the head,
this must be it. (<i>Points to tail.</i>) No, this is the head.
Now for it. (<i>Reads.</i>) “Grasp the knife firmly in the
right hand,”&mdash;that’s so,&mdash;“take the fork in the left;”
but what shall I do with the “Art of Carving”? It
doesn’t say anything about that: I’ll fix it. (<i>Places
book on the table.</i>) Now (<i>reads</i>), “stick the fork in No.
8.” That must be No. 8. “Draw your knife across
No. 11”&mdash; (<i>Enter Pete, <span class="smcapuc">R.</span></i>)</p>

<p><i>Pete.</i> Did you ring, sar?</p>

<p><i>Sam.</i> No, I didn’t ring, you outrageous ignorant&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Pete.</i> Beg pardon, sar. Must have been 84. (<i>Aside.</i>)
Spoons are dar. (<i>Exit, <span class="smcapuc">R.</span></i>)</p>

<p><i>Sam.</i> Blast 84! What does he ring for just as I’ve<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
got my knife across No. 11? I must go all over it again.
(<i>Reads.</i>) Put your fork in No. 4, draw your knife across
No. 11&mdash; (<i>Enter Steve, <span class="smcapuc">L.</span></i>)</p>

<p><i>Steve.</i> Did you ring, sir?</p>

<p><i>Sam.</i> Ring, you blasted upstart? (<i>Aside.</i>) With my
fork in No. 4 and my knife across No. 11! How was I
to ring? (<i>Aloud.</i>) Ring?&mdash;no.</p>

<p><i>Steve.</i> Beg pardon, sir; it must have been 82.
(<i>Aside.</i>) Spoons all right. (<i>Exit, <span class="smcapuc">L.</span></i>)</p>

<p><i>Sam.</i> 82 be blowed! This is a queer proceeding.
I’ll try it again. Put your fork in No. 4, draw your
knife across No. 11, force yourself, and off comes the
(<i>pulls the goose on to the floor</i>) blasted animal. (<i>Enter
Pete, <span class="smcapuc">R.</span>, and Steve, <span class="smcapuc">L.</span></i>)</p>

<p><i>Steve.</i> (<i>Pointing, <span class="smcapuc">R.</span></i>) There it is, sir.</p>

all my trouble, I must go back to No. 4. (<i>Places goose
on platter.</i>) No, I wont; I’ll push ahead and trust to
luck. (<i>During the remainder of this speech tries in various
places to carve the goose.</i>) This is the toughest

O Annastasia! that leg wont come off. O Annastasia!

shall I do with him? I can’t eat him, and I should get
laughed at if it should be seen. I’ll give him away to
some poor individual. (<i>Looks out of door, <span class="smcapuc">L.</span></i>) Nobody

<p><i>Bobby Small</i> (<i>outside, <span class="smcapuc">L.</span></i>) Shine your boots? (<i>Enter,

<p><i>Bobby.</i> Oh, can’t stand the press? Look ahere, gent,

to go over to Bunker Hill? Stand on my head, play yer

somebody’s been mauling on him.</p>

<p><i>Sam.</i> Yes, all right, just cooked; here, take him and
leave. (<i>Ties up goose in a napkin, accidentally slipping

<p><i>Steve.</i> Connubial? You mean a cannibal.</p>

<p><i>Pete.</i> By golly! Steve, it’s Smiff,&mdash;John Smiff. Cotch
him wid de axe! cotch him wid de axe!</p>

<p><i>Steve.</i> Here, take these things right down, and tell
Mr. Hanscomb. Be quick, for the gong will sound for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
dinner in three minutes. (<i>Enter Sam, <span class="smcapuc">L.</span></i>) More spoons,

<p><i>Pete.</i> More spoons, spoons, monster! (<i>Exit, <span class="smcapuc">R.</span></i>)</p>

<p>Sam. What does this mean? Oh, horror! a light
dawns upon me. Spoons, spoons! I must have given
away one of the spoons with the goose. I remember
there was one in the dish. Oh, heavens! what’s
to be done? They’ll have me arrested. Where can
my uncle, the captain, be? I can’t find him anywhere,
and he’s got all the money. Oh, Annastasia, why did you
ask me to learn the horrid art of carving? Oh, what
will become of me? Oh, agony, agony! I’ll ring the
bell and disclose all. (<i>Rings the bell, <span class="smcapuc">R.</span> As the gong
sounds outside, Sam stumbles back over the carpet-bag,
then over a chair, falls behind table, and crawls out in
front as the gong ceases.</i>) Oh, what have I done, what
have I done? Hear the crockery go! I’ve pulled down
a whole crockery shop. (<i>Enter Steve, <span class="smcapuc">L.</span></i>)</p>

<p><i>Steve</i> (<i>fiercely</i>). Did you ring?</p>

<p><i>Sam.</i> No, I didn’t touch anything,&mdash;I say, much
broke?</p>

<p><i>Steve.</i> Much broke! you’ll find out what’s broke.
(<i>Exit, <span class="smcapuc">L.</span></i>)</p>

<p><i>Sam.</i> What’s to be done? That upstart’s gone for
an officer. It wont do for me to stop here. I’ll make a
run of it. (<i>Starts for door, <span class="smcapuc">L.</span> Enter Steve, with a
broom.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Steve.</i> You can’t pass here.</p>

<p><i>Sam.</i> Oh, excuse me; I’ll go the other way. (<i>Enter
Pete, <span class="smcapuc">R.</span>, with a paper.</i>) This port blockaded?</p>

<p><i>Pete.</i> Yes, massa, by Burnside. (<i>Touches him in
side with poker.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Sam.</i> Oh, oh, you ignoramus! do you want to torture
me?</p>

<p><i>Pete.</i> Only a little game of poker, massa.</p>

<p><i>Sam</i> (<i>fiercely</i>). This is insulting! What do you
mean by stopping an Englishman in this way?</p>

<p><i>Steve.</i> Want to overhaul you, to see if there is anything
contraband aboard.</p>

<p><i>Pete.</i> ’Taint de fust time a British <em>mail</em> has been
stopped.</p>

<p><i>Sam.</i> I must submit. What would Annastasia say?
It must be that unfortunate goose. I can’t pay my bill
till I find my uncle, the captain. (<i>Enter Bobby, stealthily,
<span class="smcapuc">L.</span>, with the goose. Makes frantic efforts to attract
Sam’s attention.</i>) There’s that urchin again. What
is he making such awful faces for?</p>

<p><i>Bobby</i> (<i>aside</i>). The gent gave me a spoon with the
goose. It must have been by mistake, so I brought it
back. Perhaps the gent will stand a dime. (<i>To Sam.</i>)
Sh, sh! I’ve got it.</p>

<p><i>Sam</i> (<i>seizing him</i>). Got it! so have I. Audacious!
(<i>Seizes goose.</i>) Here’s the goose (<i>takes out spoon</i>), and
here’s the spoon. Hurrah! I’m saved. (<i>Enter Mr. Hanscomb,
<span class="smcapuc">L.</span></i>)</p>

<p><i>Hanscomb.</i> Are you? That’s a very ingenious
dodge, Mr. John Smith, but it wont do. Steve, seize
that man; and you, Pete, look after the boy. (<i>Steve
seizes Sam; Pete takes Bobby by the collar.</i>) You’re a
handsome couple, you are! What have you to say for
yourselves?</p>

<p><i>Bobby.</i> Look here, contraband, don’t soil my linen.
I say, gent, what kind of a scrape have you got me into?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Sam.</i> I am innocent, I am innocent, I am innocent!</p>

<p><i>Pete.</i> Dat’s a lie, dat’s a lie, dat’s a lie! Jest look
at dat poor old gobbler; somebody’s massacred him.</p>

<p><i>Hanscomb.</i> Take them to the station-house at once.</p>

<p><i>Sam.</i> Oh, dear! is there no escape? Oh, Annastasia,
if thou couldst only see the agony of thy unfortunate
Samuel! Will nobody save me?</p>

<p><i>Capt.</i> (<i>outside, <span class="smcapuc">L.</span></i>) O Sammy, Sammy! where are
you, Sammy?</p>

<p><i>Sam.</i> My uncle, the captain, at last. (<i>Enter captain,
<span class="smcapuc">L.</span>, his face very pale, wrapped in a blanket, and shivering.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Capt.</i> Oh, Sammy, oh, Sammy, I’m so sick! I want to
go home, I want to go home. I went down-stairs, and
a chap there as was a sailor wanted me to go over to
Chelsea, and the horrid ferry-boat made me sick, and the
awful pipe made me sick, and I want to go home. (<i>Falls
into Sam’s arms.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Sam.</i> In the “Jemima”?</p>

<p><i>Capt.</i> No, never; don’t let me see the water again,
or a ship, or a sailor. I hate the sea, and I want to
go home. (<i>Falls into Sam’s arms again.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Sam.</i> But I can’t go; I’m arrested for stealing.</p>

<p><i>Capt.</i> Arrested for stealing! Who accuses the
nephew of Capt. Nat Skillings of stealing?</p>

<p><i>Hanscomb.</i> Capt. Nat Skillings, of Dismaltown,
Nova Scotia?</p>

<p><i>Capt.</i> Just so.</p>

<p><i>Hanscomb.</i> I used to know a Capt. Skillings, of Dismaltown,
but he was not a sea captain.</p>

<p><i>Capt.</i> Well, I guess it’s the same man. I sha’n’t be
one after to-day.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Hanscomb.</i> Captain, don’t you remember your old
friend, Sol Hanscomb?</p>

<p><i>Capt.</i> To be sure I do.</p>

<p><i>Hanscomb.</i> Well, I’m his son.</p>

<p><i>Capt.</i> Be you, though? Why, how you have grown!
But what have you been doing to my nephew?</p>

<p><i>Hanscomb.</i> That your nephew! I thought it was
John Smith.</p>

<p><i>Capt.</i> Not a bit of it. That’s Sam Skillings.</p>

<p><i>Hanscomb.</i> Not John Smith! I’m confounded.</p>

<p><i>Steve.</i> Not Smith? I’m dumb.</p>

<p><i>Pete.</i> Not Smiff? I’m (<i>Bobby touches him with
the poker, which he has rescued</i>) scorched.</p>

<p><i>Sam.</i> Yes, Sam Skillings, who would scorn to do a
mean action, but who accidentally purloined one of this
gentleman’s spoons, for which he is willing to make all
possible reparation.</p>

<p><i>Capt.</i> Oh, I see how it is; Sam has been practising
the art of carving.</p>

<p><i>Hanscomb.</i> The art of carving? Why, I’ll teach him
that in twenty minutes.</p>

<p><i>Sam.</i> Will you, though? I’ll be greatly obliged to
you; so will Annastasia, and my uncle, the captain, skipper
of the “Jemima”&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Capt.</i> Sammy, sink the ship. I’ve concluded that
the sea don’t agree with my constitution. I’ll sell her.
(<i>To audience.</i>) Is there anybody here wants her? She’s
A1¾, stanch and well-built, copper-bottomed, and tarred
throughout, especially the cabin; Morgan stock, sound
and kind in harness; will stand all winds, especially
nor-nor-east, nor-east by nor, shiver my timbers&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Steve</i> (<i>offering tobacco-box</i>). Have a chew, captain?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Capt.</i> (<i>falls into Sam’s arms.</i>) Oh, Sam, Sam, take
me home!</p>

<p><i>Hanscomb.</i> Ladies and Gentlemen, “The Fatted
Calf” has been opened under rather unfavorable circumstances,
but if you will give us another call, you
shall find a hospitable landlord&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Steve.</i> Accommodating waiters&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Pete.</i> Who&mdash;who&mdash;who will gib you ebery detention,
wid&mdash;wid&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Bobby.</i> De Union polish.</p>

<p><i>Sam.</i> And if a word from me would not be out of
place, I would recommend this house, as I expect to stop
here with my Annastasia on our bridal tour, on which
occasion we expect to be accompanied by that extraordinary
seaman&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Capt.</i> Oh, Sammy, don’t.</p>

<p><i>Sam.</i> My uncle, the captain.</p>

<p><i>Lucy.</i> What seems to be the matter?</p>

<p><i>Bridget.</i> An’ shure, ma’m, I dont know, except that
she’s failin’, and failin’, and failin’; an’ its sorry the
day whin she fell ill; she’s the kindest and bist misthress
in the world. (<i>Crying.</i>) Oh, musha, musha!
Oh, dear! Oh, dear!</p>

<p><i>Lucy.</i> Well, well, Bridget, be calm, and hope for the
best.</p>

<p><i>Bridget.</i> Faith, and that’s what I’m doin’. Oh, here
comes Miss Alice, the poor disconsilite orphan. (<i>Exit, <span class="smcapuc">L.</span></i>)</p>

<p><i>Alice.</i> (<i>Running to <span class="smcap">Lucy</span> and kissing her.</i>) Why,
Lucy Aiken! You dear, good-for-nothing thing! Where
have you been all this while?</p>

<p><i>Lucy.</i> It is an age since we met. I must congratulate
you, and I assure you I do, with all my
heart, on your altered position. So, the rich and crusty
old uncle, who forgot his relations while living, has remembered
you in his will?</p>

<p><i>Alice.</i> Yes, Lucy; thanks to uncle Caleb, we are
rich. And, I assure you, we were glad to be remembered.</p>

<p><i>Lucy.</i> But, dear me, Alice, what a careless creature
I am! How is your mother? Bridget tells me she is
very sick.</p>

<p><i>Alice.</i> Poor mother! this sudden turn in the wheel
of fortune has been too much for her; she is a confirmed
invalid. I don’t know what to make of her.
Dr. Tincture can find no symptoms of disease. He
says she is in sound bodily health; her suddenly dropping<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
her usual employments has occasioned her seeming
illness.</p>

</div>

<p><i>Lucy.</i> Seeming! Why, Alice, you treat lightly what
your Bridget seems to consider a very serious illness.</p>

<p><i>Alice.</i> Well, I do; for I am convinced nothing ails
mother. Her head is turned with the idea that she is an
invalid, because she thinks it fashionable for rich ladies
to be ailing, and she has the queerest notions. I suppose
you will laugh, but I am going to tell you her last
freak. She is highly incensed at Dr. Tincture, refuses to
see him, and declares her illness can only be cured by
some mysterious agency. Yesterday she bade me prepare
this note to be inserted in the evening papers.
(<i>Reads.</i>) “<span class="smcap">No Cure, no Pay.</span>&mdash;A lady who is suffering
from a disease which baffles the skill of the medical
profession, and who is desirous of testifying her appreciation
of the efforts now being made to institute a
school of female practitioners, offers the sum of five
hundred dollars to any female who will cure her. Address,
with real name, ‘<span class="smcap">Bedridden</span>,’ Station A, Boston
Post Office; and remember, No cure, no pay.” Did
you ever hear of such a nonsensical whim?</p>

<p><i>Lucy.</i> What an odd idea! And do you propose to
send it?</p>

<p><i>Alice.</i> No, indeed; that is, if I can possibly prevent
it. But she believes it has already gone. Dear
me! I wish I could find a way to frighten her into
health again.</p>

<p><i>Lucy.</i> That’s just what you must do. If you will
be guided by me, her cure can be effected. You remember
our “Private Theatricals” last winter, and what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
fun we had. Let us turn our practice then to profit now.
There’s Jenny Carter and Susie Dean all ready for any
harmless sport, I know. You leave this to me, and I’ll
send your mother a few samples of the new school she
so much admires.</p>

<p><i>Alice.</i> Oh, capital! capital! But are you quite sure
you can carry out this scheme?</p>

<p><i>Lucy.</i> Sure. Remember what Richelieu says about
“the bright lexicon of youth,” and leave all to me. Good-by;
I must run and see the girls. Set your heart at rest;
we’ll have your mother well before she knows it herself.
Good-by. (<i>Exit, <span class="smcapuc">L.</span></i>)</p>

<p><i>Alice.</i> Good-by. I have great faith in Lucy. And
I do hope this scheme of hers will be a success. Perhaps
it is wrong to deceive poor mother; but that advertisement
once inserted in the papers, we should have
no peace day or night. Here she comes. Poor mother;
she works very hard to keep up her sickness. I can
hardly refrain from laughing to see her bright, rosy face,
and the utter lassitude of her body.</p>

Ahem! Bad, bad!</p>

<p><i>Mrs. L.</i> Not a bit.</p>

<p><i>Jenny.</i> Not a bit? Bad, bad! Madam, yours is a
very bad case.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. L.</i> Oh, do, doctor, tell me the worst!</p>

<p><i>Jenny.</i> Madam, you are suffering from a terrible
disease,&mdash;a disease of which the profession know but
little. Hum-buga; a disease caused by a depression of
the eliminating vesticubia of the scareophagus. Had
you fallen into the hands of the masculine butchers of
the medical profession, your fate would have been terrible;
but we of the new school are destined to lay bare
new fountains of health. I propose to treat your case by
an entirely new method; one that is destined to make a
great revolution in medicine. The Lionian Method,&mdash;I
will briefly explain. You, madam, are suffering from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
prostration,&mdash;a superabundance of weakness. In your
case, madam, it is necessary to throw off this superabundance
of weakness; but how to supply the vacuum?
What is needed? You see at once: strength. But
where shall we find strength?&mdash;in the mineral world?
No. In the vegetable world? No. Where shall we
turn? To the animal world, and there we find strength;
and where greater strength than in the lion, the king of
beasts? There is our remedy. Madam, I prescribe for
you a lion diet. Lion steaks for breakfast, roast lion for
dinner, cold lion for supper; and lion broth, lion soup,
and lion fricassees promiscuously. Obey me, and you
are saved; hesitate, and you are lost.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. L.</i> Dear me! but where shall I get the lions?</p>

<p><i>Jenny.</i> That’s none of my business. I prescribe the
mode; you must find the means. You are rich; send
and catch them. I would recommend your keeping a
few live lions in your back garden, that you may have
them fresh at all times.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. L.</i> Lions in our back garden? Mercy! we
should be eaten alive!</p>

<p><i>Aunt M.</i> Lions? What! turn our back garden into
a howling wilderness?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. L.</i> Dear me, dear me! I can never find the
means of cure.</p>

<p><i>Jenny.</i> Then I cannot help you. So, if you will
just hand me a check for five hundred dollars, I’ll go.
(<i>Puts on bonnet.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Mrs. L.</i> (<i>Starting up.</i>) A check for what?</p>

<p><i>Jenny.</i> A check for five hundred dollars.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. L.</i> But you haven’t cured me. You forget,
“No cure, no pay.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Jenny.</i> Ah, but I’ve prescribed a method that will be
sure to cure. If you don’t choose to try it, that’s not
my fault.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. L.</i> You just start yourself out of this house.
Quick, or I’ll find a way to send you. Quick, I
say.</p>

<p><i>Jenny.</i> Very well, madam; very well. Remember
the law. You’ll find you must pay. Good-morning.</p>

dear! My camphor,&mdash;quick! Fan me, child, fan me!</p>

<p><i>Alice.</i> Well, mother, your first attempt with the new
school is a failure. You’d better give it up, and send
for Dr. Tincture.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. L.</i> Child, don’t mention that horrid name again.
(<i>Bell rings.</i>) Who can that be? Another one of those
humbugs.</p>

you say so.</p>

the matter with her&mdash;is there? What’s the matter?
Got the rheumatics?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. L.</i> Oh, dear! I don’t know what’s the matter.</p>

<p><i>Susan.</i> Kinder stericky&mdash;ain’t yer? Let’s see your
tongue. It’s awful red! Let me feel your pulse. Dear
me! Why, what can be the matter?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. L.</i> I am very weak.</p>

<p><i>Susan.</i> Got a crick in your back?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. L.</i> I don’t know, but I think I have.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Mrs. L.</i> (<i>Putting her hand to her head.</i>) Oh, terrible!</p>

<p><i>Susan.</i> Purty bad way, yeou are. Let me see.
There’s catnip,&mdash;that ain’t powerful enough; then
there’s penny-<em>rial</em> and wormwood, thoroughwort and
hy-sup; them won’t do yeou any good; we must try the
new grassalogical treatment.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. L.</i> The grassalogical treatment! What is
that?</p>

<p><i>Aunt M.</i> Hay?</p>

<p><i>Susan.</i> A new discovery of our larned sister, Dr.
Sally Wiggins. The Scripters tell us, “All flesh is
grass.” Therefore, when the flesh is weak, what more
nat’ral than that we should fly to its great counterpart in
nature, the grass?</p>

<p><i>Aunt M.</i> (<i>Aside.</i>) Talking about counterpanes,&mdash;I’d
like to show her my new patch-work quilt.</p>

<p><i>Susan.</i> On this theory Dr. Sally has founded her
new treatment; and I think it will be the best thing
yeou can try. Take for breakfast every day grass tea;
grass greens biled for dinner, with a leetle pork or
bacon; grass tea for supper&mdash;nothing else, and sleep
on the grass nights. If natur’ won’t work a cure in
your case, then I’m much mistaken.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. L.</i> Sleep on the grass? Why, you’re crazy!</p>

<p><i>Aunt M.</i> Why, I do believe that woman wants to
turn our Angelina out to paster, jest like a cow.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. L.</i> I confess I do not see the logic of your new
treatment.</p>

<p><i>Susan.</i> Yeou don’t? Well, it does look kinder
strange, but it’s the new school; and if woman is ever to
find her speare, her speare must be in some new school.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Mrs. L.</i> I shall decline following any such nonsensical
prescription.</p>

<p><i>Susan.</i> Very well, mam. If you won’t, you wont;
and that’s all there is about it. So, when you’re ready
to settle, I’m ready to start.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. L.</i> (<i>Starting up.</i>) Ready to settle! What do
you mean?</p>

<p><i>Susan.</i> Five hundred dollars. That was your offer.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. L.</i> No cure, no pay. What have you done?</p>

<p><i>Susan.</i> Given you an original mode of treatment.
If you do not choose to follow it, that’s not my fault.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. L.</i> You just take your roots and herbs and your
new treatment, and start out of this house, or you’ll get
worse treatment.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. L.</i> Aunt Midget&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Aunt M.</i> Well, child.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. L.</i> Do try and talk to this woman; she’s deaf
as a post, I’m sure.</p>

<p><i>Aunt M.</i> Poor, is she? Wants cold victuals, I s’pose.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. L.</i> No, no; she’s a doctor.</p>

<p><i>Aunt M.</i> (<i>Pulling her chair close to <span class="smcap">Mrs. L.</span>, and
speaking across her to <span class="smcap">Alice</span>.</i>) What’s the matter?</p>

<p><i>Alice.</i> (<i>Moving her chair close to <span class="smcap">Mrs. L.</span>, they both
speak very loud.</i>) Hay?</p>

<p><i>Aunt M.</i> What’s&mdash;the&mdash;matter?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Alice.</i> I’m deaf. (<i>Pronounce</i> deef.)</p>

<p><i>Aunt M.</i> Dear me! she want’s some beef. Well, if
poor folks ain’t gitting proud! I guess you’ll have to
content yourself with good cold bread.</p>

<p><i>Alice.</i> Yes; it is caused by colds in the head.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. L.</i> Dear me! set the blind to lead the blind.
Aunt Midget, this old lady is very deaf.</p>

<p><i>Aunt M.</i> You don’t say so. (<i>Very loud.</i>) What do
you want?</p>

<p><i>Alice.</i> To treat the lady.</p>

<p><i>Aunt M.</i> Hay?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. L.</i> Gracious! what a confusion! My good
woman, aunt Midget, this lady, is also very deaf.</p>

<p><i>Alice.</i> I want to know. (<i>Very loud to <span class="smcap">Aunt M.</span></i>) I
want to treat this lady.</p>

<p><i>Aunt M.</i> Want to treat her? (<i>Very loud.</i>) What
with?</p>

<p><i>Alice.</i> (<i>Louder.</i>) I’m a doctor.</p>

<p><i>Aunt M.</i> Doctor, hey! Medical or dedical?</p>

<p><i>Alice.</i> I’m a female physician.</p>

<p><i>Aunt M.</i> Musician too! What do you play on?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. L.</i> Stop, stop, stop! Do you want to craze me,
you two? Bridget, Bridget! My good woman, I do
not require your services.</p>

<p><i>Enter <span class="smcap">Bridget</span>, <span class="smcapuc">L.</span></i></p>

<p>Here, show this woman out of the house, quick!</p>

<p><i>Alice.</i> I’m a regular&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Bridget.</i> Oh, no more of yer blarney! Start yourself
quick!</p>

<p><i>Alice.</i> But, my dear lady, you advertised&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Bridget.</i> (<i>Pushing her off, <span class="smcapuc">L.</span></i>) Ah, away wid yer!
Away wid yer!</p>

<p><i>Mrs. L.</i> (<i>Sinks into her chair.</i>) Oh, dear! was ever
a poor sick woman so abused! My camphor, aunt
Midget; my camphor! Where can Alice be?</p>

<p><i>Enter <span class="smcap">Alice</span>, <span class="smcapuc">L.</span></i></p>

<p><i>Alice.</i> Here I am, mother; I was called down stairs
to see a lady, a healing medium. She is very desirous
of seeing you.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. L.</i> I will not see her. Those we have had have
nearly killed me.</p>

<p><i>Alice.</i> But, mother, this is an entirely different sort
of person. You must see her, for she is coming up
stairs now.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. L.</i> Oh, dear, dear! Am I never to have any
peace?</p>

<p>(<i>Enter <span class="smcap">Lucy</span>, disguised. A bloomer costume (a bathing-dress
will answer the purpose), an old-fashioned “front”
of hair with side curls, a straw hat and parasol.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Lucy.</i> My dear child, which is your afflicted parent!</p>

<p><i>Alice.</i> This is her.</p>

<p><i>Lucy.</i> (<i>Seats herself, <span class="smcapuc">L.</span> of <span class="smcap">Mrs. L.</span></i>) She does,
indeed, seem afflicted! That care-worn face, those weak
and feeble limbs, are sure signs of the presence of
disease.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. L.</i> Here is one who understands me at last.</p>

<p><i>Lucy.</i> The power has been given me to heal the sick.
(<i>Twitches her right arm.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Mrs. L.</i> Mercy! what’s the matter?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Aunt M.</i> That girl’s going into a fit.</p>

<p><i>Lucy.</i> It’s nothing; be as quiet as you can. (<i>Left
arm twitches.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Aunt M.</i> Gracious goodness! I tell you, Angelina,
that gal’s in a fit! (<i><span class="smcap">Lucy’s</span> head jerks, and she stares
fixedly at <span class="smcap">Aunt M.</span></i>) See her glare at me! I tell you
she’s crazy. Angelina, if you don’t have that woman
taken away, I’ll holler right eout!</p>

<p><i>Lucy.</i> Sh&mdash;! I behold a vision! I see a woman
before a wash-tub&mdash;a stout, rosy, healthy woman. She
looks like you; and she rubs and sings, rubs and sings.
(<i>With imitation of rubbing.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Mrs. L.</i> That’s me&mdash;that’s just like me!</p>

<p><i>Lucy.</i> I see her again! She’s ironing now; and she
irons and sings, irons and sings. (<i>Imitates.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Mrs. L.</i> Just like me&mdash;just like me!</p>

<p><i>Lucy.</i> And now she sweeps (<i>imitates</i>), and now
scrubs (<i>imitates</i>), singing all the while. Hark! what is
it she sings?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. L.</i> (<i>Singing.</i>)</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<p class="center">(<i>To be found in the “Excelsior Song-Book.”</i>)</p>
</div>

<p><i>Lucy.</i> Yes, yes! That’s it! But now it changes.
I see her again: she appears feeble and weak, and complains.
Oh, how she complains! (<i>Imitates.</i>)&mdash;“Oh,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
dear! Oh, dear! I’m so weak&mdash;I’m so weak! My
camphor, aunt Midget! Fan me, my child!”</p>

<p><i>Mrs. L.</i> Oh, dear! that’s me.</p>

<p><i>Lucy.</i> (<i>Gesticulating, as though shaking somebody.</i>)
What is this that now urges me to seize this woman and
shake her?</p>

<p><i>Aunt M.</i> Angelina, that gal’s going to fight somebody.
Don’t yer come a-near me.</p>

<p><i>Lucy.</i> (<i>Slowly approaching <span class="smcap">Mrs. L.</span></i>) All this woman
needs is exercise, and I must give her exercise. (<i>Imitating
shaking.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Aunt M.</i> (<i>Jumping into chair.</i>) Massy sakes! this
is a raving lunatic.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. L.</i> (<i>Starts up.</i>) Come, come, young woman,
this is quite enough.</p>

<p><i>Alice.</i> You musn’t touch my mother.</p>

<p><i>Aunt M.</i> That gal’s a Shaker; I know she is.</p>

<p><i>Lucy.</i> (<i>Still approaching her.</i>) To shake this woman&mdash;to
shake this woman!</p>

<p><i>Mrs. L.</i> This woman declines being shaken. I’ll do
all the shaking myself. (<i>Seizes <span class="smcap">Lucy</span> and shakes her.</i>)
What do you mean by such conduct? Who are you?
(<i>Shakes her again, which shakes off her “front” and hat.</i>)
Lucy Aiken! Why, what does this mean?</p>

<p><i>Lucy.</i> That I have turned physician, owing to the
extraordinary inducements held out in an advertisement
entitled “No Cure, no Pay.”</p>

<p><i>Mrs. L.</i> What?</p>

<p><i>Alice.</i> Yes, mother, I thought it a pity to waste
money in advertising when we had three such good female
physicians in the neighborhood.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Enter <span class="smcap">Jenny Carter</span> and <span class="smcap">Susan Dean</span>, <span class="smcapuc">L.</span>, disguised as
before.</i></p>

<p>Here are the other two.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. L.</i> And pray, who are they? (<i><span class="smcap">Jenny</span> and
<span class="smcap">Susan</span> throw off their bonnets.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Jenny.</i> A disciple of the lionian school!</p>

<p><i>Mrs. L.</i> Jenny Carter!</p>

<p><i>Susan.</i> And a student of the grassalogical treatment.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. L.</i> Susan Dean! Well, I am amazed.</p>

<p><i>Aunt M.</i> (<i>Getting down from chair.</i>) If that gal’s
got through her tantrums, I’d like to get down!</p>

<p><i>Mrs. L.</i> But there was another&mdash;a deaf old lady.</p>

<p><i>Alice.</i> (<i>Imitating.</i>) Hay?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. L.</i> Why, Alice! have you been concerned in
this too? Do you know it was very wrong to deceive
your mother in this way?</p>

<p><i>Alice.</i> Perhaps it was, mother; but I think you are
better for the very singular treatment you have met
with.</p>

<p><i>Aunt M.</i> Law, child, what are you thinking of?
You have been standing nearly five minutes.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. L.</i> And I propose to stand five minutes more,
for the purpose of thanking these young ladies for the
very excellent manner in which they have treated my
complaint. Ah, Lucy, that little touch of the old life
you gave me has awakened my slumbering energies. I
think I shall be able to go about and do a portion of
that duty which is given the rich to perform&mdash;succor
the needy and relieve the distressed. In such employment
I need fear no return of my complaint. But how
can I reward you?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Alice.</i> Remember your promise; five hundred dollars&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Lucy.</i> Which we gladly renounce, looking for reward
in the approval of our friends here.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. L.</i> But will they grant it? If, like me, in
your practice they have found a cure for idle complainings,
they certainly will; if not, you must all remember
the conditions&mdash;<span class="smcap">No Cure, No Pay</span>.</p>

<p><i>Knock.</i> Whipstock, my boy, how goes the strike?</p>

<p><i>Whip.</i> As well as could be expected. It’s evident we
shall have to give in. Old Greenbax is still determined
not to pay the advance asked for.</p>

<p><i>Knock.</i> Won’t he? We’ll see about that. The strike
has continued but eight days, and they have used up
all means in their power to get conductors and drivers.
I saw the seven o’clock car standing before the station,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
waiting for somebody to put it through. We have taken
good care nobody shall be found; and I rather think
this predicament will bring our worthy president to
terms. There’s nothing like a little pluck, my boy.</p>

<p><i>Whip.</i> Oh, yes; it’s all very well for you to talk, who
have a chance at the pickings; but as for me, I’m
pretty well played out; and if old Greenbax don’t come
down soon, I shall, with a rush.</p>

<p><i>Knock.</i> Nonsense! Never say die, my boy.</p>

<p><i>Whip.</i> I don’t mean to; but if this thing continues
much longer, Mrs. Whipstock will say it for me, emphasized
with a broomstick. Halloo! here’s old Greenbax.
Now for a breeze.</p>

<p><i>Enter <span class="smcap">Greenbax</span>, <span class="smcapuc">R.</span></i></p>

<p><i>Green.</i> (<i>As he enters.</i>) Trumps! Trumps! I say,
where can that fellow be? Trumps! (<i>Sees <span class="smcap">Knockdown</span>
and <span class="smcap">Whipstock</span>.</i>) Halloo! what are you doing
here? Ready to go to work, hey!</p>

<p><i>Knock.</i> Yes, sir, ready to go to work&mdash;at the advance
prices.</p>

<p><i>Green.</i> Hum! (<i>To <span class="smcap">Whipstock</span>.</i>) And are you ready
to drive?</p>

<p><i>Whip.</i> Certainly&mdash;at the advance prices.</p>

<p><i>Green.</i> (<i><span class="smcapuc">C.</span></i>) Hum! Will you both serve us faithfully?</p>

<p><i>Whip and Knock.</i> (<i>Advancing eagerly on each side of
him, and speaking quickly.</i>) Oh, yes, sir; yes, indeed!</p>

<p><i>Green.</i> At the advance prices? I’ll see you farther,
first, and then I won’t. No, sir; we pay you too much
now. Clear out, both of you. I don’t want you around
here. Quit! Exit! Vamose!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Whip.</i> Did you ever! The old curmudgeon! <i>Exit <span class="smcapuc">R.</span></i></p>

<p><i>Knock.</i> No, I never! The skinflint! <i>Exit, <span class="smcapuc">R.</span></i></p>

<p><i>Green.</i> (<i>Seating himself at desk.</i>) Here’s a pretty condition
for the Broadaxe Horse Railroad to find itself
placed in. A parcel of whipsnappers dictating to Horatio
Greenbax, president of the corporation. Strike
away, you scoundrels! You’ll find those who have the
longest pockets can strike the hardest and stick the
closest. (<i>Enter <span class="smcap">Trumps</span>, <span class="smcapuc">R.</span></i>) Well, Trumps, what’s
up now?</p>

<p><i>Trumps.</i> We are, I should say. Here’s the seven
o’clock car waiting for both driver and conductor, and
none to be had.</p>

<p><i>Green.</i> Then get new ones.</p>

<p><i>Trumps.</i> It’s very well to say get new ones; but
where to get them, is the question. Our discharged
men have induced everybody in the neighborhood to
refuse.</p>

<p><i>Green.</i> They have, have they? (<i>Voices heard outside
shouting, “Halloo!” “Conductor!” “Time’s up!”
“Halloo!” “Hurry up!” “Hurry up!”</i>)</p>

<p><i>Trumps.</i> There, you hear that; the passengers are
impatient.</p>

<p><i>Green.</i> Well, well; drive it yourself.</p>

<p><i>Trumps.</i> I can’t do that; somebody must look after
the company’s property. (<i>Voices heard again impatiently
shouting.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Enter <span class="smcap">Hartshorn</span>, <span class="smcapuc">L.</span></i></p>

<p><i>Harts.</i> Mr. Pwesident, what is the meaning of this
wow, and wiot, and wumpus? ’Pon my word, this is
decidedly wulgaw; we shall be disgwaced with such an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
outwageous disturbance in fwont of our door&mdash;we
shall, indeed.</p>

<p><i>Green.</i> The fact is, Mr. Hartshorn, the company finds
itself destitute of both drivers and conductors, in consequence
of the strike.</p>

<p><i>Harts.</i> Stwike! what a wevolution! You alawm me&mdash;you
do, indeed.</p>

<p><i>Green.</i> Well, don’t get frightened; you won’t be
struck.</p>

<p><i>Harts.</i> What’s to be done?</p>

<p><i>Green.</i> Don’t know; unless you volunteer to drive
that car down.</p>

<p><i>Harts.</i> I volunteaw to dwive a paiw of vulgaw howses
down Bwoadway, and one of these filthy caws too! I
nevaw! The effluviaw fwom those cadavewous cweatures
is howible! ’pon my word, howible! (<i>Voices
again.</i>) There’s the wow again!</p>

<p><i>Enter <span class="smcap">Hardhead</span>, <span class="smcapuc">R.</span></i></p>

<p><i>Hard.</i> Where’s the president of this confounded road?</p>

<p><i>Green.</i> I believe I have the honor to be its presiding
officer.</p>

<p><i>Hard.</i> Hey?</p>

<p><i>Green.</i> I am he.</p>

<p><i>Hard.</i> Hey? Speak louder; what are you mumbling
about?</p>

<p><i>Green.</i> (<i>Very loud.</i>) I am the presiding officer.</p>

<p><i>Hard.</i> Coffee, sir? I didn’t say any thing about coffee.
I’ve had my breakfast, and, if it hadn’t been for that
infernal car, should have been down town before this.</p>

<p><i>Green.</i> This old gent is a little hard of hearing.</p>

<p><i>Trumps.</i> It hasn’t affected his vocal organs, anyhow.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Harts.</i> Yaas; he’s got an impediment in his eaw.</p>

<p><i>Hard.</i> What do you all stand there growling for?
Why don’t you answer me?</p>

<p><i>Green.</i> I am the person you want.</p>

<p><i>Hard.</i> Hey?</p>

<p><i>Green.</i> (<i>Very loud.</i>) I&mdash;am&mdash;the&mdash;President.
(<i>Lower.</i>) Confound your picture!</p>

<p><i>Hard.</i> Oh, you are; then you ought to be ashamed of
yourself. What’s that car waiting for?</p>

<p><i>Green.</i> Somebody to drive.</p>

<p><i>Hard.</i> Hey?</p>

<p><i>Green.</i> (<i>Very loud and angrily.</i>) Want somebody
to drive.</p>

<p><i>Hard.</i> Somebody’s wife? What business have you
to keep a car waiting for somebody’s wife? I don’t ask
you to wait for my wife&mdash;do I? Where’s your conductor?</p>

<p><i>Green.</i> He’s on a strike.</p>

<p><i>Hard.</i> Hey?</p>

<p><i>Green.</i> (<i>Very loud and excitedly, and flourishing his
arms.</i>) I tell you he’s indulging in a strike.</p>

<p><i>Hard.</i> (<i>Raising his cane.</i>) Oh, that’s your little game,
is it? You want to indulge in a strike! Well, indulge,
then. Come on, you scoundrel; I’ll strike!</p>

<p><i>Green.</i> No, no! (<i>Dodging behind <span class="smcap">Hartshorn</span>.</i>) I
don’t mean any thing of that kind. Keep off!</p>

<p><i>Harts.</i> Good gwacious! what a tewible monstaw!</p>

<p><i>Hard.</i> (<i>To <span class="smcap">Hartshorn</span></i>,)&mdash;Oh, you’ll have it&mdash;will
you, Whiskers? You want a crusher&mdash;do you?</p>

<p><i>Harts.</i> No, no; I don’t want a cwusher! (<i>Dodges
behind <span class="smcap">Greenbax</span>.</i>) I won’t have a cwusher!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Trumps.</i> (<i>Stepping before <span class="smcap">Hardhead</span>, and speaking
very loud.</i>) Beg pardon, sir; but you misunderstand.
Our drivers have struck for higher wages.</p>

<p><i>Hard.</i> Oh, that’s it. Why didn’t he say so? (<i>To
<span class="smcap">Greenbax</span>.</i>) Well, what are you going to do about it?
I must go down town at once.</p>

<p><i>Green.</i> (<i>Loud.</i>) If you will be patient a few minutes,
we will try to accommodate you.</p>

<p><i>Hard.</i> Look here, Mr. &mdash;&mdash; (<i>to <span class="smcap">Trumps</span></i>), what is that
individual’s name?</p>

<p><i>Trumps.</i> Greenbax.</p>

<p><i>Hard.</i> Look here, Mr. Beeswax; if you don’t hurry
up that car, I’ll have you arrested as a swindler.
(<i>Voices outside again.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Trumps.</i> Come, Mr. Greenbax, something must be
done at once.</p>

<p><i>Green.</i> What can I do?</p>

<p><i>Trumps.</i> Hire the men at the new prices.</p>

<p><i>Green.</i> Never! I said I wouldn’t, and I won’t, if
no cars run to-day.</p>

<p><i>Trumps.</i> Very well, sir; I have done all I can do.
(<i>Exit.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Hard.</i> Are we going down to-day or not?</p>

<p><i>Green.</i> I wish you was down where you belong, with
all my heart. (<i>Louder.</i>) Very warm to-day, sir.</p>

<p><i>Hard.</i> Hey?</p>

<p><i>Green.</i> It’s very warm to-day.</p>

<p><i>Hard.</i> Pay? I’ll pay you if you don’t start that car
soon. (<i>Goes up to table and sits.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Green.</i> O, pshaw! it’s no use talking to him. Well,
Hartshorn, what’s to be done?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Harts.</i> ’Pon my word, I don’t know. S’pose you
dwive down yourself.</p>

<p><i>Green.</i> Me? When I do, just inform me&mdash;will
you? (<i>Noise again outside.</i>) Halloo! Who’s this?</p>

<p><i>Enter <span class="smcap">Finnegan</span>, <span class="smcapuc">R.</span></i></p>

<p><i>Fin.</i> Is the prisidint widin, I dunno?</p>

<p><i>Green.</i> Well, I do. He is; and I am he.</p>

<p><i>Fin.</i> Yer are&mdash;are yez? O, yer spalpeen! and it’s
there ye are, thaif!</p>

<p><i>Green.</i> Come, come; be a little more respectful.</p>

<p><i>Fin.</i> Respictful, is it? By my sowl, and ain’t you
the sarvant of the public? and ain’t I the public,
bedad? What do yer mean by kaping me standing outside
there squatting in a car, and waiting to be took to
the arms of Biddy and the childers, afther I’ve fit, bled,
and died for ould Ireland up in Can-a-dy, shure I’d like

<p><i>Hart.</i> Good gwacious! what a fewocious foweigner!</p>

<p><i>Fin.</i> And who the deuce are you, onyhow? You
chatter like a monkey, and you look like a baboon! By
my sowl, I believe you’re Barnum’s What Is It!</p>

<p><i>Green.</i> Come, come; this won’t do.</p>

<p><i>Fin.</i> Won’t it? and who’s to hinder, I’d like to
know? Faith, do ye mind who I am? I’m a full-blooded
Fenian; ready to sthrike for ould Ireland; and
if that car don’t start soon, I’ll strike you, ye blackguard.
(<i>Flourishing his shillalah.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Green.</i> Come, come; be quiet. (<i>Dodging behind
<span class="smcap">Hartshorn</span>.</i>) Pacify him, Hartshorn.</p>

<p><i>Harts.</i> Pacify him? Good gwacious! here’s another<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
stwiker! Don’t flouwish that club in that mannaw.
Gweenbax will talk to you. (<i>Dodges behind <span class="smcap">Greenbax</span>.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Green.</i> Put up that stick. You shall have a conveyance
in five minutes.</p>

<p><i>Fin.</i> Conveyance, is it? I want no conveyance. I
want a car, and that quick.</p>

<p><i>Hard.</i> (<i>Starting up and shouting.</i>) Is that car going
or not?</p>

<p><i>Fin.</i> Faith, here’s another belated gint. (<i>To <span class="smcap">Greenbax</span>.</i>)
Don’t yer hear the gintleman?</p>

<p><i>Green.</i> Confound the gintleman, and the car too.
Was ever a president in such a fix? Here’s another!
Well, come on all at once.</p>

<p>(<i>Enter <span class="smcap">Dan</span>, <span class="smcapuc">R.</span></i>)</p>

<p><i>Dan.</i> Say! where’s the president of this here road?
Say!</p>

<p><i>Hard.</i> Is that car going?</p>

<p><i>Fin.</i> Fetch on your conveyance, ould chap.</p>

<p><i>Green.</i> One at a time, if you please. (<i>To <span class="smcap">Dan</span>.</i>) I
am the president. What do you want?</p>

<p><i>Dan.</i> Well, say, old cove, what do yer mean by
keepin’ folks waitin’ in this style, say?</p>

<p><i>Fin.</i> Faith, ould gint, if yer don’t spake up, there’ll
be “say” enough to dhrown ye.</p>

<p><i>Green.</i> There’s a little delay on account of the strike.</p>

<p><i>Fin.</i> Sthrike, is it? A sthrike, bedad! I’m on hand
like a picked-up dinner. I sthruck a blow for ould Ireland
in Can-a-dy, and then I sthruck for home; and, bedad,
I’ll sthrike for any thing at all, at all.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Dan.</i> I say, Pat, hush yer jaw; we’ll jest clean out

<p><i>Fin.</i> Faith, that we will. It’s a dirthy place onyhow.</p>

<p><i>Hart.</i> Good gwacious! there’s going to be more
stwiking!</p>

<p><i>Dan.</i> Look here, Smellin’ Bottle! (<i>Seizes <span class="smcap">Hartshorn</span>

<p><i>Hart.</i> Good gwacious! Welease my coat! You awe

<p><i>Dan.</i> Am I? Jest look a here, Smellin’ Bottle! and

I does; and I kills fur Swizel too; and I’m goin down
town in that car in five minutes! You understand?</p>

<p><i>Hard.</i> (<i>Shouting.</i>) Is that car going, or is that car
not going?</p>

<p><i>Dan.</i> Say, old gent, you jest subside.</p>

<p><i>Hard.</i> Hey?</p>

<p><i>Fin.</i> Faith, the ould gint’s as dafe as a haddock.
(<i>Goes up to table and talks to <span class="smcap">Hardhead</span> in dumb show.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Dan.</i> Now, prez, I want yer to understand I’m a goin’
down town; and I want a driver and a conductor.</p>

<p><i>Green.</i> But I tell you there is a strike.</p>

<p><i>Dan.</i> Yes; and there’ll be another very soon. Here,
Smellin’ Bottle, I guess you can drive pretty well.</p>

<p><i>Harts.</i> Good gwacious! Me? O, nevaw. I should
be exhausted at once! I should indeed!</p>

<p><i>Dan.</i> Then we’ll exhaust you. Come, heave ahead,
and take the ribbons.</p>

<p><i>Harts.</i> But, good gwacious! considaw; I should soil
my dwess; I should indeed!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Dan.</i> Well, we’ll fix that. Here, Pat.</p>

<p><i>Fin.</i> (<i>Coming down.</i>) Here yer are, my darlint.</p>

<p><i>Dan.</i> Bring some old clo’s in here from that next
room&mdash;the dirtiest yer can find.</p>

<p><i>Harts.</i> Good gwacious!</p>

<p><i>Fin.</i> Faith, that I will. (<i>Exit, <span class="smcapuc">R.</span></i>)</p>

<p><i>Green.</i> I protest against this proceeding. You are
trespassing upon the premises of the Broadaxe Railroad.</p>

<p><i>Dan.</i> Oh, simmer down, now; your turn will come
soon.</p>

<p>(<i>Enter <span class="smcap">Finnegan</span>, <span class="smcapuc">R.</span>, with a couple of dirty old overcoats
and a couple of shocking bad hats.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Fin.</i> Here you are.</p>

<p><i>Dan.</i> Now, Smellin’ Bottle, jump into this. (<i>Holding
up the dirtiest overcoat.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Harts.</i> Good gwacious! what a howible coat!
No, nevaw; twy the pwesident. (<i>Dodges behind <span class="smcap">Greenbax</span>.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Dan.</i> All right. (<i>Seizes <span class="smcap">Greenbax</span>.</i>) Prez, jump
in.</p>

<p><i>Green.</i> No; I will submit to no such outrage. I am
the president of this corporation.</p>

<p><i>Fin.</i> Thin we’ll invist you wid this robe of office.</p>

<p>(<i><span class="smcap">Dan</span> and <span class="smcap">Finnegan</span> seize <span class="smcap">Greenbax</span>, and thrust him

<p><i>Green.</i> Oh, you shall suffer for this!</p>

<p><i>Fin.</i> We do, my darlint; now for your crown.
(<i>Claps hat on his head.</i>) Ivery inch a king!</p>

<p><i>Dan.</i> Now, then, for Smellin’ Bottle. (<i>Seizes <span class="smcap">Hartshorn</span>.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Harts.</i> Good gwacious! I’m innocent; I am indeed!
I’m only a poor diwector.</p>

<p><i>Fin.</i> Thin come here directly. (<i>Seizes him, puts on
coat and hat, he all the time protesting.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Green.</i> Oh, if there is any law, you shall suffer for
this!</p>

<p><i>Hard.</i> Is that car going?</p>

<p><i>Dan.</i> Directly. We’ve procured a driver and conductor,
and now we’re off. Come, Pat, lead off with
the prez&mdash;I mean driver.</p>

<p><i>Fin.</i> Faith, that I will.</p>

<p><i>Dan.</i> And I’ll take Smellin’ Bottle. (<i>They take
<span class="smcap">Greenbax</span> and <span class="smcap">Hartshorn</span> by the arm, who struggle
and protest.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Green.</i> (<i>To <span class="smcap">Hardhead</span>, who comes down.</i>) This is
an outrage. I call upon you to protect me.</p>

<p><i>Hard.</i> Hey?</p>

<p><i>Harts.</i> Yes, yes; pwotect me, pwotect me!</p>

<p><i>Hard.</i> Hey?</p>

<p><i>Fin.</i> Bedad! that ould gint is like a horse; he’s full
of hay!</p>

<p><i>Dan.</i> Now we’ll be down town in a jiffy. Come on.</p>

<p><i>Enter <span class="smcap">Trumps</span>, <span class="smcapuc">R.</span></i></p>

<p><i>Trumps.</i> What’s the meaning of this?</p>

<p><i>Dan.</i> We’ve procured a conductor and a driver for
the seven o’clock car.</p>

<p><i>Trumps.</i> We don’t want them.</p>

<p><i>Dan.</i> Yes; but we do.</p>

<p><i>Trumps.</i> No; for the conductor and driver have
come to terms; and if you’ll jump aboard, we’ll be off
in a jiffy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Green.</i> Strike over?</p>

<p><i>Trumps.</i> Entirely.</p>

<p><i>Harts.</i> Good gwacious! that’s lucky!</p>

<p><i>Dan.</i> You can bless your lucky stars, prez.</p>

<p><i>Green.</i> I do; and if ever there’s another strike on
this road, I’ll resign at once.</p>

<p><i>Fin.</i> (<i>To <span class="smcap">Hardhead</span>.</i>) Strike’s over!</p>

<p><i>Hard.</i> Hey?</p>

<p><i>Fin.</i> (<i>Loud.</i>) The strike’s over.</p>

<p><i>Hard.</i> Anybody knocked down?</p>

<p><i>Dan.</i> The conductors will attend to that part of the
business.</p>

<p><i>Trumps.</i> Come, gentlemen, jump on; can’t wait any
longer.</p>

<p><i>Green.</i> Jump on, gentlemen; the strike has concluded
to our satisfaction; let us hope it has to the satisfaction
of all who have taken this little trip with us on the
Broadaxe Horse Railroad.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Act 1.</span></h3>

<p class="scene"><span class="smcap">Scene.</span>&mdash;<i>Parlor in the house of <span class="smcap">Dr. Harlem</span>.
Table, <span class="smcapuc">L.</span>, with chair <span class="smcapuc">R.</span> of it; arm-chair, <span class="smcapuc">L. C.</span>; small table
with chair, <span class="smcapuc">R.</span>; <span class="smcap">Lucy</span>, <span class="smcapuc">R.</span>, sewing; <span class="smcap">Mrs. Loring</span> seated in
arm-chair, reading.</i></p>

<p><i>Mrs. L.</i> Lucy, my child, how very quiet you are!</p>

<p><i>Lucy.</i> Indeed, Aunt Loring, I cannot help it. You
know to-day is the very last of the term. School closed;
all the pupils gone except Fred Hastings and Bob Winders,
and they leave us to-day: the thought of the quiet
humdrum life we are to lead for the next two months
makes me feel very sad.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. L.</i> The change will be a relief to all of us. Think
of your father: he needs the rest which the close of the
term will bring.</p>

<p><i>Lucy.</i> I do think of him; and for his sake I am glad.
But still we lose many friends in the young gentlemen
who have left us. I’m sure we shall miss them.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. L.</i> Especially your particular friend, Fred
Hastings; hey, Lucy?</p>

<p><i>Lucy.</i> Oh! of course. You know he is very agreeable,
Aunt Loring, and has been very kind to us.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. L.</i> He is no favorite of mine. He has been
very agreeable, especially to you; while to your brother
Harry he has been altogether too kind.</p>

<p><i>Lucy.</i> Why, Aunt Loring! Harry thinks there never
was such a friend.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. L.</i> Harry is young; he has seen little of the
world: and the gay, dashing style of Fred Hastings has
won his admiration. But Master Fred Hastings has
already led him into mischief. Their pranks in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
village have reached my ears, and, I fear, those of your
father. Fred Hastings is not a fit companion for our
Harry; and it will be a relief to me when he quits this
place never to return.</p>

<p><i>Lucy.</i> Don’t talk so, Aunt Loring. You are mistaken
in him.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. L.</i> I hope I am. But, during the ten years I
have been housekeeper for your father, I have seen a great
many young men, and learned to read their characters;
and I say that Master Fred Hasting has too much money,
too much assurance, and too much love for what is called
sport, ever to make a good man.</p>

<p><i>Lucy.</i> I do hope you are mistaken. I’m sure you
must be.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. L.</i> Well, well, child, we shall see.</p>

<p><i>Butts.</i> (<i>Outside, <span class="smcapuc">C.</span></i>) Don’t tell me. How do you
know? None of your lying. I’ll find out for myself.
(<i>Enter <span class="smcap">Butts</span>, <span class="smcapuc">C.</span></i>) How do you do, marm? Hope you’re
well, Miss Lucy. Where’s the doctor?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. L.</i> He’s out, Mr. Butts. What is the matter?</p>

<p><i>Butts.</i> Matter! What should be the matter, when a
set of jackanapes are allowed to roam through the village,
pillaging, burning, and insulting? I won’t have it: the
law shall be respected.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. L.</i> Burning and pillaging! Why, Mr. Butts,
have any of our young gentlemen been engaged in such
disreputable proceedings?</p>

<p><i>Butts.</i> Worse than that, marm. Worse than that.
I’m disgusted with seminaries. If I could have my
way, there shouldn’t be any thing like a school in the
land.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Mrs. L.</i> Then I’m very glad you do not have your
way. What is the cause of complaint now?</p>

<p><i>Butts.</i> The majesty of the law has been outraged;
and I, as the representative of the law, have been insulted.
Those rascals of yours have been at their pranks.
Going to my office this morning, I found a crowd of the
rag, tag, and bobtail of the village gathered about it,
hooting and yelling at some object in the window.
Madam, imagine my indignation when I found that object
to be a stuffed figure wrapped in my dressing-gown, with
a foolscap on its head, and labelled “Jonathan Wild
Butts, Thief-taker,”&mdash;seated in my arm-chair too, at the
open window. Think of that, marm!&mdash;an outrage, a
diabolical outrage, upon justice!</p>

<p><i>Mrs L.</i> Who could have done it?</p>

<p><i>Butts.</i> You ask that, marm?&mdash;you who have lived
for ten years in this den of iniquity, this nursery of
roguery, this incubating machine of vice? Who did it?&mdash;why,
Dr. Harlem’s pupils, of course.</p>

<p><i>Lucy.</i> Why, Mr. Butts! They’re all gone except
Fred Hastings and Bob Winders.</p>

<p><i>Butts.</i> Except&mdash;Add your brother Harry, and you
have the ringleaders in every assault upon the peace and
quiet of the place. I know them. I’ve winked at many
of their misdeeds; but, when they assault justice, I tell
you Jonathan Wild Butts has his eye on ’em. I say,
respect the law, respect the law.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. L.</i> I assure you, Mr. Butts, I have a great
respect for the law and its officers. Take a seat. The
doctor will soon return.</p>

<p><i>Butts.</i> No, I thank you, marm. I’ll call again. It’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
my duty to keep an eye on rogues; and I flatter myself
I know my duty. Let the wicked tremble; for justice is
on their track. (<i>About to exit, <span class="smcapuc">C.</span>, runs against <span class="smcap">Dilly</span>,
who enters, <span class="smcapuc">C.</span></i>)</p>

<p><i>Dilly.</i> Dear me, Mr. Butts. Don’t knock a body
down.</p>

<p><i>Butts.</i> (<i>Taking her by the ear, and bringing her down
stage.</i>) Ah, ha, you little baggage! I’ve got you at
last.</p>

<p><i>Dilly.</i> Don’t, Mr. Butts: you hurt. I ain’t done nothing.</p>

<p><i>Butts.</i> Look me in the eye.</p>

<p><i>Dilly.</i> Which one, Mr. Butts?</p>

<p><i>Butts.</i> Silence!</p>

<p><i>Dilly.</i> Well, you needn’t holler so: I ain’t deaf.</p>

<p><i>Butts.</i> Silence! You took my horse and chaise yesterday
while I was in Mr. Bates’s house, drove through the
town like mad; and, when I found them, they were
locked up in the pound, the horse in a perspiration, and
the chaise nearly stove to pieces. What have you to say
to that?</p>

<p><i>Dilly.</i> Let my ear alone. I won’t tell you a word
until you do.</p>

<p><i>Butts.</i> Speak out, quick! What did you take my
chaise for?</p>

<p><i>Dilly.</i> La, Mr. Butts! I didn’t mean to hurt it. You
posted a notice on the church-door, warning people to
beware of leaving horses in the street over twenty minutes;
for, if they did, their horses should be put in the
pound, and their owners fined.</p>

<p><i>Butts.</i> What’s that got to do with my horse?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Dilly.</i> Respect the law, Mr. Butts. I saw your horse
stand at Mr. Bates’s door over half an hour; and you
know what’s sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander:
and so I drove him to the pound. Ain’t you much
obliged?</p>

<p><i>Butts.</i> Much obliged, you young jackanapes? If ever
I find you meddling with my horse again, I’ll have
you locked up in a pound where you won’t get out in a
hurry.</p>

<p><i>Dilly.</i> La, Mr. Butts, don’t get angry! What’s the
use of making laws, if you break them yourself.</p>

<p><i>Butts.</i> Oh, bother! Precious little you know about
law. Good-morning, Mrs. Loring; good-morning, Miss
Lucy (<i>going, <span class="smcapuc">C.</span></i>).</p>

<p><i>Dilly.</i> Good-morning, Mr. Butts: going to have a
ride?</p>

<p><i>Butts.</i> Oh, bother!</p>

<p><i>Dilly.</i> I say, Mr. Butts&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Butts.</i> Well, what now?</p>

<p><i>Dilly.</i> Respect the law.</p>

<p><i>Butts.</i> Oh, pshaw! (<i>Runs off, <span class="smcapuc">C.</span></i>)</p>

<p><i>Dilly.</i> Ha, ha, ha! What a queer old customer!</p>

<p><i>Lucy.</i> Why, Dilly!</p>

<p><i>Mrs. L.</i> Dilly, child, you mustn’t talk so.</p>

<p><i>Dilly.</i> That’s what Harry calls him.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. L.</i> That’s no reason why you should speak so.
Mr. Butts is a very worthy man, and tries to do his duty.</p>

<p><i>Dilly.</i> He’s a constable, and I do hate constables:
they’re always round poking their noses into every thing,
and spoiling all the fun.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. L.</i> It is his duty, child, to look after mischief-makers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Dilly.</i> But he makes such a fuss about it, and he
always manages to catch the wrong ones.</p>

<p><i>Lucy.</i> He didn’t catch the wrong one to-day. Why,
Dilly, how could you do such a thing?</p>

<p><i>Dilly.</i> Pooh! It is easy enough if you only know
how to drive.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. L.</i> That poor horse!</p>

<p><i>Dilly.</i> Well, it’s Mr. Butts’s fault that he is poor. He
ought to feed him: I’m sure he’s rich enough! Harry
says he’s an old&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Mrs. L.</i> Stop, child! never mind what Harry says.</p>

<p><i>Dilly.</i> But I do mind what Harry says. Harry’s my
father and mother and brother all in one. I’m sure I
shouldn’t know what to do without Harry.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. L.</i> You have great cause to love him, for to
Harry you owe all you have.</p>

<p><i>Dilly.</i> Yes: he found me a little bit of a girl in the
streets, and brought me home. Don’t I love him for it,
though? He calls me such queer names! Don’t you
think, auntie, this morning, he called me “Little Bread
upon the Waters.” What a queer name! I’m sure I don’t
know what it means.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. L.</i> I’ll tell you, Dilly. Nine years ago, the night
before you were brought here, Dr. Harlem, Harry, and
myself were sitting in this very room. The doctor, as
usual, was reading from the Scriptures before retiring for
the night. During the reading, this sentence attracted
Harry’s attention, “Cast thy bread upon the waters,
for thou shalt find it after many days.” Harry looked
up with his bright eyes. “That’s a queer sentence,
father,” said he. “Ah, my boy!” said the doctor,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
“there’s many sentences in this book to puzzle young
heads like yours, and many to puzzle older ones than
mine. ‘Cast thy bread upon the waters’ means, do all
the good you can in this world, never looking for reward;
for it will always come, sooner or later. Do a good
deed, be it to benefit rich or poor, high or low; for your
reward will surely come.” The next morning, Harry
drove his father to the village at a very early hour, as the
doctor was going a journey, and wanted to catch a train.
On his return, he saw a little bundle of rags by the way-side.
He alighted, and was surprised to find a little girl
four or five years old, almost dead,&mdash;a poor little sick,
suffering thing, evidently left to die by some inhuman
mother.</p>

<p><i>Dilly.</i> That was me, wasn’t it, auntie?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. L.</i> That was you. Harry looked at you, and
was about to turn away, when he remembered the lesson of
the previous night. “Father says, ‘Cast thy bread upon
the waters,’” said he; “so this little one shall go home
with me.” The doctor was very much surprised on his
return, and very much inclined to send you to the poorhouse;
but Harry begged so hard to keep you, that he
relented, and here you have been ever since.</p>

<p><i>Dilly.</i> That’s why Harry called me, “Bread upon
the Waters.” I wonder if such a little crumb as I am
can ever repay him.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. L.</i> No doubt, Dilly.</p>

<p><i>Dilly.</i> Perhaps I shall turn out to be some rich heiress,
that some cruel uncle wanted to get out of the way.
If I do, won’t I make Harry rich!</p>

<p><i>Mrs. L.</i> There’s not much chance of that. No clew
could be found to your parentage.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Dilly.</i> And I hope there never will be. I don’t want
to leave Harry and you, auntie, and Lucy, and the dear
good doctor. If I’m a nobody, I mean to be happy; and,
if ever I can do any thing for Harry to repay him for&mdash;for&mdash;for&mdash; (<i>Bursts
into tears.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Mrs. L.</i> There, there, Dilly, don’t cry. We all love
you dearly; and, while you live, there is a warm home for
you in Greenlake. Come with me. I’ve got a new canary
in my room. (<i>Exit, <span class="smcapuc">R.</span></i>)</p>

<p><i>Dilly.</i> A canary? Oh, my! ain’t that splendid?
(<i>Exit, <span class="smcapuc">R.</span></i>)</p>

<p><i>Lucy.</i> Harry in danger! I do not believe it. Fred
Hastings is a dear, delightful fellow, and I am sure would
lead nobody into danger.</p>

<p><i>Bob.</i> (<i>Without, <span class="smcapuc">C.</span></i>) O Lord! O murder! oh, bring
somebody here quick! (<i>Enter, <span class="smcapuc">C.</span>, dragging a trap, in
which his foot is caught.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Lucy.</i> Why, Bob, what have you been doing?</p>

<p><i>Bob.</i> Practising your favorite song, “I’ve been roaming,
I’ve been roaming;” and this is the consequence.</p>

<p><i>Lucy.</i> Ah! too many sharps in that tune for you.</p>

<p><i>Bob.</i> Altogether. I don’t like the measure. Won’t
you be kind enough to release me?</p>

<p><i>Lucy.</i> Certainly. (<i>Releases his foot.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Bob.</i> Thank you. Ah, Lucy, if I only had you to
release me from all the traps I get into!</p>

<p><i>Lucy.</i> Oh, pshaw! you should keep out of them. Now,
I’ll warrant you’ve been in somebody’s melon-patch.</p>

<p><i>Bob.</i> Lucy, you wrong me. But it’s just my luck. I
never shall be understood. I’m born to be unappreciated
in this world. I haven’t been in any melon-patch at all.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
I climbed Farmer Butts’s wall to gather a bouquet for
you, when I stuck my foot in it. It’s just my luck. I
never tried to gather a rose but what I stuck my hands
full of thorns.</p>

<p><i>Lucy.</i> Ah, Bob, you went too near Farmer Butts’s
melon-patch.</p>

<p><i>Bob.</i> Well, now you mention it, I did take a look at
them there bouncers, and they seemed to say, “Come and
take us melons;” but this trap said, “<em>Can’t elope</em>,” and
fastened its cruel teeth in my tender ankles. Just my luck.</p>

<p><i>Lucy.</i> O Bob! I’m ashamed of you.</p>

<p><i>Bob.</i> Now, don’t, Lucy! I’m an unfortunate chap.
I was born to be unlucky. I tell you, you should have
had the most beautiful melon,&mdash;I mean bouquet,&mdash;if it
hadn’t been for this trap. Just my luck! Here I’ve
been sent to this school by my fond but mistaken parent
to be fitted for the bar or the pulpit. Fit subject I am
for either. The only bar I hanker for is a horizontal
bar. I’d like to be a gymnast, join a circus, or something
of that kind; but there, you see, I’m too fat. It’s
just my luck. If I go out with the boys on a frolic, I’m
sure to get caught. If I race on the water, my weight
either capsizes the boat, or leaves me a mile behind. I
tell you, Lucy, I’m born to ill luck.</p>

<p><i>Lucy.</i> Oh, no, Bob! Have more confidence in yourself.</p>

<p><i>Bob.</i> Confidence! Well, I like that. Confidence in
what? I’m always at the foot of the class, always the
last one up in the morning, and always the last in every
thing. Oh, dear! I wonder what will become of me. If
it wasn’t for Harry, I should drown myself. No, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
couldn’t do that. I’m too fat: I couldn’t sink. Just my
luck.</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> No! Have you? What luck?</p>

<p><i>Bob.</i> Oh! I caught some.</p>

<p><i>Lucy.</i> Yes: brought them home in a trap too.</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> Oh, ho!</p>

<p><i>Fred.</i> Ha, ha!</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> Been in that melon-patch again?</p>

<p><i>Fred.</i> O you rascal!</p>

<p><i>Fred.</i> Selfish chap! Wanted them all for himself.</p>

<p><i>Bob.</i> Oh, bother! I was only reconnoitering.</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> And got snatched by the sharpshooters.</p>

<p><i>Bob.</i> Sharpshooters! you may well say that. Such
sharp, shooting pains as I’ve had in my ankles!</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> Served you right.</p>

<p><i>Bob.</i> Just my luck!</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> Never go into anybody’s melon-patch without
your friends.</p>

<p><i>Fred.</i> No, sir! Greedy boys always get punished.</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> Well, you bounce into the kitchen with them,

you shall be my champion in the race. Here, sir!
you shall wear my colors. Kneel, and receive from the

<p><i>Harry.</i> Hold on, Mr. Butts: this is a serious charge.
We acknowledge we have sometimes overstepped the strict
boundaries of the law; but to break into a man’s office is
something not even the mischief-loving pupils of Greenlake
Seminary would be guilty of. Explain yourself!</p>

<p><i>Doctor.</i> Well, well, young gentlemen, you seem to be
amusing yourselves in an unwonted manner. May I

<p><i>Butts.</i> That’s it, doctor,&mdash;assault with intent to
drown. It’s a diabolical conspiracy against the law.</p>

<p><i>Doctor.</i> Harry, Master Hastings, Master Winders, I
am waiting for an explanation.</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> Father, that man charged three of your
pupils with falsehood: we couldn’t stand that. He was
hot and angry.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Bob.</i> And so we thought we’d just cool him off, that’s
all.</p>

<p><i>Butts.</i> But they’re a pack of jackanapes, violating
the law, and then denying it.</p>

<p><i>Doctor.</i> Gently, Mr. Butts. My boys, however mischievous
they may be, are ready to own their faults without
resorting to falsehood. What is your complaint?</p>

<p><i>Butts.</i> They broke into my office, insulted me by
placing a stuffed figure in my window, with my name
upon it, and this confounded ridiculous thing on its head
(<i>pulls foolscap from his pocket, and places it on his head</i>).
Behold the insulted majesty of the law!</p>

<p><i>Doctor.</i> Allow me to look at that cap, Mr. Butts.
This is made of one of my papers; and, as it bears my
name upon it, it certainly came from this place. Now, who
is the culprit? Harry, I have heard of your pranks in
town, though you fancied I was ignorant of them. You
will answer me truly. Is this your work?</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> No, sir. I have not been near Mr. Butts’s
office for three days.</p>

<p><i>Doctor.</i> Master Hastings?</p>

<p><i>Fred.</i> I assure you, doctor, I had nothing to do with it.</p>

<p><i>Doctor.</i> Master Winders, can you throw any light on
this proceeding?</p>

<p><i>Bob.</i> What! I dress old Butts in a foolscap? No,
sir. I couldn’t see any joke in that; that’s what I call
twitting on facts.</p>

<p><i>Doctor.</i> Then who is the culprit?</p>

<p><i>Dilly.</i> If you please, doctor, it was me.</p>

<p><i>All.</i> You, Dilly!</p>

<p><i>Dilly.</i> Yes: it was me.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Butts.</i> Why, you little scarecrow, do you mean to say
that you did this? I don’t believe it.</p>

<p><i>Dilly.</i> La, Mr. Butts, you’re never satisfied. You’ve
been growling because nobody would confess; and now,
when I’m ready to own it, you won’t believe me.</p>

<p><i>Doctor.</i> Dilly, if this was your doings, you will please
explain it.</p>

<p><i>Dilly.</i> Well, then, I went to Mr. Butts’s office this
morning to let him know his horse was in the pound.</p>

<p><i>Doctor.</i> His horse in the pound?</p>

<p><i>Dilly.</i> Yes: I’ll tell you about it.</p>

<p><i>Butts.</i> There, there! no matter about that.</p>

<p><i>Dilly.</i> Well, I thought you wouldn’t care to hear
about it. Well, I went to Mr. Butts’s office, and Mr. Butts
wasn’t there: the door was locked; so I tried the window.
It was unfastened. I jumped in, saw Mr. Butts’s dressing-gown
and boots, dressed up something to look like him,
and opened the window.</p>

<p><i>Butts.</i> What did you do it for?</p>

<p><i>Dilly.</i> To scare the rogues, Mr. Butts. They would
think it was you. It was just as good as though you
were there.</p>

<p><i>Butts.</i> You little, confounded, saucy!&mdash;I’ll dress
you! I’ll make an example of you, now I’ve caught
you!</p>

<p><i>Dilly.</i> La, Mr. Butts, didn’t you never catch a rogue
before?</p>

<p><i>Butts.</i> Silence!</p>

<p><i>Doctor.</i> Leave her to me, Mr. Butts. Dilly, I’m
astonished that a young lady of your age should be
guilty of such a proceeding.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Dilly.</i> Dear me, doctor, I didn’t mean any harm: I
only wanted a frolic, and it was such a good chance!</p>

<p><i>Butts.</i> Frolic?&mdash;an insult to an officer of the law, you
call a frolic? I’ve been insulted. You let me catch you
in my office again, that’s all! Frolic!&mdash;shades of the
chief justices, ghosts of departed judges! Oh, I shall
choke! (<i>Exit, <span class="smcapuc">C.</span></i>)</p>

<p><i>Doctor.</i> If I hear of such a frolic again, Dilly, I
shall be very angry with you. Don’t do it again.
(<i>Exit, <span class="smcapuc">R.</span></i>)</p>

<p><i>Dilly.</i> There, now! the doctor’s angry. I didn’t
mean any harm. It’s such fun to plague Mr. Butts!</p>

<p><i>Bob.</i> Served him right, the old scamp!</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> Stop, Bob! don’t encourage her: she’s wild
enough already. Dilly, come here.</p>

<p><i>Dilly.</i> What for, Harry? You going to scold me?</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> Yes, Dilly. This frolic of yours has grieved
me very much. You are too old now to indulge in such
pranks.</p>

<p><i>Dilly.</i> Why, Harry, you and Fred and Bob hoisted
Mr. Butts’s horse up into the steeple; and I’m sure you
are all older than I.</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> That’s a different matter altogether. We are
young men, and you are a young lady.</p>

<p><i>Dilly.</i> Well, don’t you think young men ought to behave
themselves, Harry?</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> Yes, of course; that is&mdash;sometimes. Oh,
pshaw! What I mean is, Dilly, I don’t want you to do
such a thing again. It will grieve me very much.</p>

<p><i>Dilly.</i> Then I’ll never do it again. I’m sure, Harry,
if you want me to be a good girl, I shall try ever so hard;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
for I love you dearly, Harry: and if ever I should grieve
you, I&mdash;I&mdash;I&mdash; (<i>Weeps.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> There, there! Run off, and finish cutting out
your stars: that’s much better than cutting up pranks.</p>

<p><i>Dilly.</i> Oh, the stars! I forgot all about them.</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> Confound it! I must turn over a new leaf.</p>

<p><i>Bob.</i> Yes, practice before you preach. Well, Dilly,
how comes on the flag?</p>

<p><i>Dilly.</i> Nearly ready. Will you come and hold a
skein of silk for Lucy? (<i>Exit, <span class="smcapuc">L.</span></i>)</p>

<p><i>Bob.</i> For Lucy? Will I? Won’t I? (<i>Exit, <span class="smcapuc">L.</span></i>)</p>

<p><i>Fred.</i> It strikes me that Bob Winders is mighty
attentive to Lucy.</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> Of course, he is. Why, Fred, you’re not
jealous?</p>

<p><i>Fred.</i> That sister of yours is an angel, Harry.</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> That she is, Fred.</p>

<p><i>Fred.</i> Do you know, Harry, that the saddest of our
parting is the thought that I shall meet her no more?
You and I are such good friends, Harry, that you will
not laugh when I tell you I love her dearly, truly.</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> Ah! a boy’s love, Fred. We know how that
will end. New scenes and new faces will blot out all
remembrance of her.</p>

<p><i>Fred.</i> I tell you, no, Harry. If I am a boy, I have
lived a man’s life for the last five years. Hers is not
the first fair face which has attracted me; but all fade
before hers. Harry, I tell you I shall leave this place
with the firm resolve to one day return, and ask her to be
my wife.</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> Your wife, Fred?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Fred.</i> Yes, my wife. You would not object to that?</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> I should, most decidedly.</p>

<p><i>Fred.</i> How?</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> Yes, Fred Hastings: I’d rather see my sister
laid in her grave than marry you.</p>

<p><i>Fred.</i> Harry, you’re crazy!</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> Not a bit of it. Look you, Fred. You’re
a gay fellow, and with you time flies lightly and merrily.
But you’re a rich man’s son. Your purse is always full.
You know too much of life. Boy as you are, you can
drink as deep as the oldest; you can shake a dice-box
as glibly as the most expert, shuffle a pack of cards
with the boldest, and bet your money with the fastest.
I can very easily tell your future life,&mdash;a gay life and a
merry one; and, with such a companion, a pure, loving
girl like Lucy would be miserable. I know all this;
for you have led me into it. So, Fred, say no more
about it. Lucy is too good for you ever to dream of.</p>

<p><i>Fred.</i> Why, Harry, what’s the matter? You have
engaged with me in all these sports that you speak of.
Do you turn upon me now? Harry, you are not yourself.</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> No, I am not. When you came to this school,
I was a happy lad who had never heard of this gay life;
content to stay at home with my dear sister and Dilly,
with but one desire,&mdash;to please a father who was very
proud of me. You came. New life, new enjoyments,
were before me; and, like a thoughtless boy, I plunged
into them. Well, I suppose it is one of the phases of
life which tempt all; but I wish I had never, never, seen
it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Fred.</i> But, Harry, what has caused this sudden
change?</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> I’ll tell you, Fred. You introduced me to
Capt. Pitman’s house, to look on at the game. I was
content, at first, to look on; but one night you tempted
me to play. I lost seventy-five dollars to Capt. Pitman,
and I had not the means to pay it. The captain was
very kind: he said the money was of no consequence: I
should give him my I. O. U. for the amount, and,
when convenient, pay it. I gave him a note.</p>

<p><i>Fred.</i> That was all right. He doesn’t want the
money.</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> Ah! but he does. He met me this morning;
said he was very sorry, but he must have it at once. I
declared my inability to pay it. He persisted, and warned
me, that, if the money was not in his hands to-day, he
should be compelled to call upon my father for an explanation.</p>

<p><i>Fred.</i> He cannot collect it. You are a minor.</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> Collect it! Do you suppose my father would
hesitate to pay, when he knows, that, on his refusal, the
whole story would be made public? Fred Hastings,
rather than look upon my father’s face&mdash;his honest face&mdash;when
he should feel his son was a gambler, I’d throw
myself into the lake.</p>

<p><i>Fred.</i> Oh, come, Harry! he shall not know it. I
got you into the scrape, and I’ll see you out. The
doctor holds money belonging to me, from which I
draw for my convenience. I’ll go to him, get the
money: you shall pay Capt. Pitman, and nobody be the
wiser.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> Will you, though? That’s kind of you, Fred;
and I’ll repay you with the first money I have.</p>

<p><i>Fred.</i> I’ll go at once.</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> And I’ll look after the boats. But don’t think
any more of Lucy, Fred; for I tell you, you can’t have
her. She’s too good for you. (<i>Exit, <span class="smcapuc">C.</span></i>)</p>

<p><i>Fred.</i> Too good for me! A saint at last! What
a rascal I must be! Too good for me! Ah, Harry
Harlem, you don’t know me yet with all your keenness.
Too good for me!&mdash;we’ll see. Oh! I’ll help you out of
the scrape, I’ll help you out. I can shake a dice-box,
can I? I can bet my money, can I? You’ve seen
all this? But there’s one little sleight-of-hand trick that
you haven’t seen yet, Master Harry Harlem. I’ll help
you out of this scrape with a vengeance. (<i>Exit, <span class="smcapuc">R.</span> Enter
<span class="smcap">Bob</span>.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Bob.</i> Just my luck! I’ve tangled all their silk, cut
their cloth in the wrong place, and upset every thing in
the room. Just my luck! The idea of a chap of my
temperament sitting down before Lucy Harlem to hold
a skein of silk, while her bright eyes were burning holes
in my susceptible bosom! Oh, it’s horrible! I’m over
head and ears in love with her. When she touches me,
the blood rushes to my head, and I rush off. I think she
likes me. I’d like to go down on my knees before her,
and say, “Lucy, I am yours.” But there, I’m too
fat. She might say, “There’s too much of you.” Here
she comes. I’ve a great mind to say something. (<i>Enter
<span class="smcap">Lucy</span>, <span class="smcapuc">R.</span></i>)</p>

<p><i>Lucy.</i> Why, Bob! what did you run away for?
You tangled my silk all up, and left me to unravel it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Bob.</i> O Lucy! you’ve tangled me all up, and I
don’t believe I shall ever be unravelled.</p>

<p><i>Lucy.</i> Why, what’s the matter?</p>

<p><i>Bob.</i> Lucy, I’m going away to-day.</p>

<p><i>Lucy.</i> I’m so sorry you’re going just at this time!</p>

<p><i>Bob.</i> You are? You don’t know how happy you
make me. Why at this time?</p>

<p><i>Lucy.</i> Because the water-melons are just ripe.</p>

<p><i>Bob.</i> Oh, pshaw! What’s water-melons to me?</p>

<p><i>Lucy.</i> A great deal, I should think. Don’t you like
them?</p>

<p><i>Bob.</i> Yes; but I like you just as well.</p>

<p><i>Lucy.</i> Why, Bob!</p>

<p><i>Bob.</i> No, no! I mean&mdash; (<i>Aside.</i>) I’ve a great
mind to speak. (<i>Pops down on his knees.</i>) Lucy&mdash; (<i>Enter

<p><i>Lucy.</i> Oh! there’s Fred.</p>

<p><i>Bob.</i> Just my luck! (<i>Jumps up.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Fred.</i> Why, Bob, what’s the matter? Have you
hurt you?</p>

<p><i>Bob.</i> No, I ain’t hurt me. (<i>Exit, <span class="smcapuc">C.</span> Enter <span class="smcap">Dilly</span>, <span class="smcapuc">L.</span></i>)</p>

<p><i>Fred.</i> I’m glad you are here, Lucy. I leave you to-day,
and, that you may not entirely forget me, may I beg
your acceptance of this. (<i>Presenting a watch.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Lucy.</i> Oh, what a splendid little watch! Thank you
a thousand thousand times for your kindness.</p>

<p><i>Dilly.</i> Oh, what a beauty! Dear me, Fred, ain’t
you going to give me something to remember you by?</p>

<p><i>Lucy.</i> Hush, Dilly.</p>

<p><i>Dilly.</i> I’m sure I shall forget you if you don’t.</p>

<p><i>Fred.</i> Oh! I haven’t forgotten you, Dilly. Here,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
take this. I’ve often heard you say you wanted a portfolio.
You shall have this. Should I ever become a
great man, you can boast that you own something which
no one but I have ever used.</p>

<p><i>Dilly.</i> Oh, thank you, Fred! That’s just what I
wanted! Isn’t it nice? I’ll go show it to auntie at
once. (<i>Exit, <span class="smcapuc">L.</span></i>)</p>

<p><i>Fred.</i> Lucy, may I not hope that the many happy
hours we have spent together here may sometimes
recall me to your remembrance?</p>

<p><i>Lucy.</i> Don’t talk so, Fred! I hope we shall meet
again often. There is no one whom I shall miss more
than you.</p>

<p><i>Fred.</i> Do you mean that, Lucy? May I hope sometime
to return, and&mdash; (<i>Enter <span class="smcap">Harry</span>, <span class="smcapuc">C.</span>, in boating

<p><i>Harry.</i> Well, Lucy, are you all ready for the race?</p>

<p><i>Lucy.</i> When you are, Harry. Look at my beautiful
present. From Fred too: isn’t he kind?</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> Very.</p>

<p><i>Lucy.</i> Well, I declare: is that all you can say?</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> I’m busy now: don’t talk. Get Aunt Loring
and Dilly. We must be off.</p>

<p><i>Lucy.</i> We’ll all be ready in a minute. (<i>Exit, <span class="smcapuc">L.</span></i>)</p>

<p><i>Fred.</i> Here, Harry, here’s your father’s check for
seventy-five dollars: settle with Capt. Pitman at once.</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> Thank you, Fred! I’ll run down and pay
him.</p>

<p><i>Fred.</i> And I’ll get ready for the race. Look out for
yourself; for I shall beat you. (<i>Exit, <span class="smcapuc">R.</span></i>)</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> Don’t be too sure of that. I’ll get this debt
off my mind. (<i>Turns to door, meets <span class="smcap">Butts</span>.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Butts.</i> Oh, here you are, here you are! I’ve been
looking for you.</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> You’re always looking for somebody. What’s
to pay now? Who do you want?</p>

<p><i>Butts.</i> You, Harry Harlem: I’ve got a little business
with you. The law has its eye on you.</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> Well, I’ve no objection, as long as it’s the eye,
and not the hand.</p>

<p><i>Butts.</i> But the hand follows the eye.</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> O pshaw! I’m in a hurry: if you have any
business with me, speak out.</p>

<p><i>Butts.</i> I’ve a little note against you, placed in my
hands for collection by Capt. Pitman.</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> Capt. Pitman! In your hands?</p>

<p><i>Butts.</i> Which, of course, you can’t pay; so my next
business is with your father.</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> Not just yet. Where is the note?</p>

<p><i>Butts.</i> Here it is; seventy-five dollars,&mdash;a large sum
for a son of Dr. Harlem to lose by gambling.</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> Sh!&mdash;Don’t speak so loud.</p>

<p><i>Butts.</i> Here it is; seventy-five dollars.</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> And here is a check for the amount.</p>

<p><i>Butts.</i> A check!</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> My father’s check: it’s good, I believe.</p>

<p><i>Butts.</i> Good as gold. Here’s your note. (<i>Aside.</i>)
There’s another job slipped through my hands.</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> So you see, old Butts, it isn’t necessary to see
my father. There’s your money. Good-day!</p>

<p><i>Butts.</i> Will you take a little bit of advice from me?</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> No, sir. I won’t take any thing from you.
You’d like to catch me tripping; but you haven’t got me
yet, Mr. Butts.</p>

<p><i>Butts.</i> No, not just yet; but, if your acquaintance
with Capt. Pitman continues, it won’t be long. Good-day!
(<i>Exit, <span class="smcapuc">C.</span></i>)</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> I’ll take good care to cut the acquaintance of
Capt. Pitman. I’ve had a narrow escape; and I’ll

no joke to robe myself in these uncomfortable clothes.

<p><i>Bob.</i> What’s the use in my attempting to race? Anyhow,
I shall be the last in. It’s just my luck!</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> Don’t growl, Bob. It’s just your luck to be
the best fellow in the world. What could we do without
you? All the small boys swear by you. If they’re in
trouble, who so quick to help as Bob Winders? If
there’s an old lady within ten miles wants an armful of
firewood, who so quick to bring it as Bob Winders?
If I was in trouble, and wanted the help of a friend, a
real friend, there’s no one I would call on sooner than
Bob Winders.</p>

<p><i>Bob.</i> Bully for you, Harry. I’d go through fire and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>

places: but it’s no use: I shall lose the race. It’s just
my luck!</p>

<p><i>Doctor.</i> Mrs. Loring, one moment; that is, if you

<p><i>Mrs. L.</i> Will you excuse me, Mr. Hastings, one
moment? (<i><span class="smcap">Fred</span> bows and exits, <span class="smcapuc">C.</span></i>) I was merely
going to see the race on the lake. The young people
desired it; and, really, I felt myself almost a girl again.</p>

<p><i>Doctor.</i> I will detain you but a moment. I have just
received an anonymous epistle, which annoys me very
much. It is not the first I have received. It refers to
Harry.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. L.</i> To Harry, doctor?</p>

<p><i>Doctor.</i> Yes. I am advised by an unknown friend to
keep my eye on him, as he is in the habit of keeping
bad company. Mrs. Loring, have you seen any thing
wild about him for the last two months?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. L.</i> No, nothing more than usual. Since school
commenced, he has taken part in many of the frolics to
which boys are accustomed. I think he will behave more
soberly when they are all gone.</p>

<p><i>Doctor.</i> I am exceedingly anxious. I have heard of
his pranks in the village: I have also heard he is somewhat
in debt.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. L.</i> I think very likely.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Doctor.</i> You take it very coolly, Mrs. Loring.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. L.</i> Because I have full faith in Harry. Certain
friendships he has formed must, of necessity, be broken
to-day; and when he is once more with us, believe me
doctor, he will be our own Harry again.</p>

<p><i>Doctor.</i> I hope you are right, Mrs. Loring. Should
harm come to that boy, it would kill me. I have set my
heart on making a noble man of him; and, should he fail
me&mdash; (<i>Enter <span class="smcap">Dilly</span>, <span class="smcapuc">C.</span></i>)</p>

off, <span class="smcapuc">C.</span></i>)</p>

<p><i>Doctor.</i> Mrs. Loring must be right. She has had
my children under her eye so long, that she is better
able to judge their characters than I with my numerous
duties constantly occupying my attention. Some meddling
person has sent these notes to annoy me. (<i>Enter

<p><i>Butts.</i> Keep cool, doctor, keep cool! It’s a terrible
blow, but keep cool: take example from me. Oh the
reprobate, the villain!</p>

<p><i>Butts.</i> O Dr. Harlem. Dr. Harlem!</p>

<p><i>Doctor.</i> Mr. Butts, will you be kind enough to explain
yourself in as few words as possible? These ejaculations
of yours may be pleasing to you, but I do not enjoy
them.</p>

is my proud boast, that I am one of the supporters of
the scale of justice,&mdash;that scale which&mdash;</p>

deliver an oration on justice, you’ll excuse me, as I have
far more important matters to occupy my attention.</p>

<p><i>Butts.</i> Dr. Harlem, I have a tender heart, and the
sight of misery is terrible to me.</p>

<p><i>Doctor.</i> What’s that to do with me?</p>

<p><i>Butts.</i> Plague take that girl!</p>

<p><i>Doctor.</i> Never mind her, but speak.</p>

<p><i>Butts.</i> Dr. Harlem, I have had occasion to call
upon you in regard to the conduct of your pupils many
times. To-day, I called upon one of your young men
to collect a note placed in my hands by Capt. Pitman.
The note was paid by giving me this check.</p>

blind the eyes of justice. Good, good: I’ve got him!</p>

<p><i>Doctor.</i> Dilly, you see I am very much engaged.
Don’t enter this room again, or I shall be very angry.</p>

<p><i>Bob.</i> And I’ve got gloriously ducked. Just my luck!</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> Congratulate me, father! I’ve beaten the
best sculler in the school.</p>

<p><i>Doctor.</i> Stop! Before you secure my congratulations
look me in the face, Harry Harlem, and answer me this:
Have you seen Mr. Butts before to-day?</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> Oh, several times.</p>

<p><i>Doctor.</i> Have you paid him any money?</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> Why&mdash;I&mdash;yes, I have. (<i>Aside.</i>) Butts
has turned traitor.</p>

<p><i>Butts.</i> Didn’t I tell you so? Didn’t I tell you so?
He gave me the check. I’ll swear it.</p>

<p><i>Doctor.</i> Harry, you hear. What have you to say?</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> I did give him that check.</p>

<p><i>Doctor.</i> So, sir, not content with making yourself the
terror of the village, not content with disturbing the quiet
of our once happy home with your wild courses, to crown
your evil life you commit a forgery.</p>

<p><i>All.</i> A forgery?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Doctor.</i> Yes, a forgery. This son of mine&mdash;hear it,
all of you&mdash;this son, of whom I was so proud, has
forged the name of his father to pay a gambling debt.</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> ’Tis false!</p>

<p><i>Doctor.</i> False, boy! Can you deny this?&mdash;this check,
which you confess you gave to Butts?</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> I did give him the check; but it was given me
by another, one who can explain every thing. You could
not think me so base as to forge the name of the kindest
and best of fathers? That check was given me by Fred
Hastings.</p>

<p><i>All.</i> Fred Hastings?</p>

<p><i>Fred.</i> Let me see it. ’Tis false! That check has
never been in my possession.</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> Fred Hastings, do you deny it?</p>

<p><i>Fred.</i> Most certainly. Harry, I would willingly
lend you my name to help you out of a scrape; but this
is a crime I look upon with abhorrence. You must
bear the blame yourself: I cannot help you.</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> Am I awake?</p>

<p><i>Doctor.</i> A lie to cover a crime! O Harry, Harry!
Is this the reward for all my love, my pride in you?</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> Father, what can I say? One whom I
thought a friend has bitterly betrayed me. I do not
know, I cannot imagine, a reason for this; but, as true
as there is a heaven above, I am innocent of crime.</p>

<p><i>Doctor.</i> Have you not frequented the gambling-house
of Capt. Pitman?</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> I have. To my shame, I confess it.</p>

<p><i>Doctor.</i> Then you are no longer son of mine. You
have bitterly betrayed the trust reposed in you, and you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
cannot hold up your head in honesty. Go! The world
is wide: find where you can a resting-place. My house
shall no longer harbor a gambler and a forger.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. L.</i> Doctor, doctor, calm yourself!</p>

<p><i>Lucy.</i> O father! don’t speak so! (<i>They lead him
to chair, <span class="smcapuc">R.</span></i>)</p>

<p><i>Doctor.</i> The cool, heartless villain!</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> Dr. Harlem (I will no longer call you father,
since you yourself cut me off), I have indeed deceived
and disgraced you by thoughtless folly; but of this crime
I am innocent. You are right. Your house is no longer
a fit place for a gambler. I can claim no friends here
now.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. L.</i> Oh, don’t say that, Harry!</p>

<p><i>Doctor.</i> Silence! Who bandies words with that villain
is no longer an inmate of my home.</p>

<p><i>Dilly.</i> Then you can set my bandbox outside the
door at once. Dr. Harlem, you’re a mean old doctor,
so you are! O Harry, Harry! I don’t know what it’s
all about; but I know there isn’t a better Harry in this
world than you. (<i>Rushes into his arms.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> Hush, hush, Dilly! ’Twill all come right
some day.</p>

<p><i>Bob.</i> Harry, there’s my hand. The case looks hard
against you, and I suppose I should be on the other side;
but I believe in you, and I stand by you. If you’re a
villain, as they say you are, I can’t see it. It’s just
my luck!</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> Bob, you’re a trump!</p>

<p><i>Dilly.</i> You won’t go, will you, Harry?</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> Dilly, I must. You cannot understand it. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
am accused of a crime, with no power to prove myself
innocent. The time will come when I can prove it.
Till then, I shall go from here.</p>

<p><i>Dilly.</i> Oh, take me with you, Harry! take me with
you! You are the one I love best in the world. I should
die without you!</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> No, Dilly: you must stay here. Be good
and gentle with father, and watch, Dilly, watch; for the
time will come when even a little maid like you can serve
me.</p>

<p><i>Doctor.</i> Oh the villain, the villain! to seek to plunder
his old father! The villain, the villain! Has he gone?</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> In one moment, doctor: my presence is hateful
to you. I have disobeyed you, and must bide the
consequences. Farewell! Where’er I go, I shall always
remember you as the kindest and best of fathers.
Farewell!</p>

<p><i>Butts.</i> Stop! You are my prisoner.</p>

<p><i>All.</i> Prisoner?</p>

<p><i>Doctor.</i> No, no, Butts! Let him go. I make no
charge.</p>

<p><i>Butts.</i> But the bank does. I have a warrant for his
arrest.</p>

<p><i>Dilly.</i> You mean old Butts! You’re always sticking
your nose into other people’s business.</p>

<p><i>Doctor.</i> But, Butts, listen to me. (<i>Takes <span class="smcap">Butts</span>, <span class="smcapuc">R.</span>,
and they talk together earnestly.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> (<i><span class="smcapuc">L.</span></i>) Oh, this is too much! Must I be
arraigned as a criminal?</p>

<p><i>Dilly.</i> Why don’t you run away? I would.</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> Thank you for the hint, Dilly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Dilly.</i> Your boat’s down at the foot of the garden.</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> And, if I strike across, I can reach the
road. Ah, Dilly! yours is a wise little head. Bob,
here. (<i><span class="smcap">Bob</span> crosses <span class="smcapuc">R.</span></i>) Can I depend upon you? Will
you stick by me?</p>

<p><i>Bob.</i> Like a poor man’s plaster. It’s just my luck!</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> Then meet me in half an hour at the big oak
by Jones’s lot.</p>

<p><i>Bob.</i> I’ll be there.</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> Now keep old Butts here, and I’ll be off.
Dilly, good-by. Heaven bless you! Be a good girl, and
have faith in Harry.</p>

<p><i>Dilly.</i> That I will! (<i><span class="smcap">Harry</span> kisses her, and creeps out,
<span class="smcapuc">C.</span>; the <span class="smcap">Doctor</span> is with <span class="smcap">Butts</span>, <span class="smcapuc">R.</span>; <span class="smcap">Fred</span> and <span class="smcap">Lucy</span>, with
<span class="smcap">Mrs. Loring</span>, back <span class="smcapuc">R.</span>, talking together.</i>) Oh, if he can
only get away! (<i>Follows him to door, <span class="smcapuc">C.</span>, and stumbles
over the trap, which was placed by <span class="smcap">Bob</span>, <span class="smcapuc">L. C.</span></i>) Dear me!
I’ve nearly broke my ankle! Why, what an ugly-looking
trap! I must take care of that.</p>

<p><i>Butts.</i> I tell you it’s no use, doctor. Law is law, and
your son must go to jail.</p>

<p><i>Doctor.</i> But, Butts, I am the only loser by this. The
bank has lost nothing.</p>

<p><i>Dilly.</i> (<i>Coming down <span class="smcapuc">R.</span> of <span class="smcap">Butts</span>.</i>) Mr. Butts, what
will you do with Harry?</p>

<p><i>Butts.</i> Lock him up in jail, where you ought to be.</p>

<p><i>Bob.</i> (<i>Coming down <span class="smcapuc">L.</span> of <span class="smcap">Butts</span>.</i>) But look here,
Mr. Butts, I’m ready to bail him, or my father is. Don’t
take him away, that’s a good fellow. I’ll help you to
take all the rogues there are in the village, only let him
off.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Dilly.</i> (<i>At door, <span class="smcapuc">C.</span></i>) He’s reached the boat, and he’s
off. (<i>Drags trap down behind <span class="smcap">Butts</span>, and sets it.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Butts.</i> Look here, young man! I know my business.
Harry Harlem must go to jail.</p>

<p><i>Dilly.</i> Oh! don’t take him to jail, that’s a good Mr.
Butts! I won’t dress up any more figures, and I won’t
steal your horse and chaise again, if you’ll only let him go.</p>

<p><i>Bob.</i> Now, do, old Butts! You’re a kind-hearted
old fellow, I know you are!</p>

<p><i>Butts.</i> Silence! The law must be respected. (<i><span class="smcap">Dilly</span>
and <span class="smcap">Bob</span> pull him <span class="smcapuc">R.</span> and <span class="smcapuc">L.</span> to attract his attention during
the previous lines. At this part, they have him in front of the
trap.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Fred.</i> (<i>Back, <span class="smcapuc">C.</span></i>) Gracious! there’s Harry half-way
across the lake! There’s innocence for you!</p>

<p><i>Doctor.</i> Escaped? Thank heavens!</p>

<p><i>Dilly.</i> (<i>Dancing, and clapping her hands.</i>) Good,
good, good!</p>

<p><i>Butts.</i> The prisoner escaped! (<i><span class="smcap">Bob</span> pushes him back
into the trap.</i>) O murder, murder! What have I
done?</p>

<p><i>Bob.</i> Put your foot in it, old Butts.</p>

<p><i>Dilly.</i> Good, good, good!</p>

<p><i>Butts.</i> (<i>Rushing round and dragging the trap.</i>) Lost
my prisoner! Murder, help! O Bob Winders, you’ve
ruined me.</p>

<p><i>Bob.</i> Have I? That’s just my luck!</p>

<h3>ACT II.<br />
<span class="smaller">FIVE YEARS SUPPOSED TO ELAPSE.</span></h3>

<p class="scene"><i><span class="smcap">Scene</span> same as Act. 1.&mdash;Table, <span class="smcapuc">R. C.</span>; arm-chair, <span class="smcapuc">L. C.</span>;
small table, <span class="smcapuc">R. C.</span>; with chair <span class="smcapuc">R.</span>, in which is seated <span class="smcap">Mrs.
Loring</span>, knitting.</i></p>

<p><i>Mrs. L.</i> Dear me, how time does fly. It’s five
years this very day since our Harry disappeared. Five
long years, and no word, no sign, from him. Perhaps
he’s dead. Poor boy, innocent or guilty, his loss has
been a sad blow to his father. Since that day, he has
never been the same man. Prostrated by a long illness,
the result of that terrible excitement, feeble in body,
wandering in mind, he is but the wreck of the grand old
doctor of former days. The school has been given up,
the house mortgaged, and what the end will be, Heaven
alone can tell. But for Dilly, this would be a sad house.
Dear child, she is the ruling spirit. When the blow fell,
forsaking all her roguish pranks, she proved herself a
woman. The doctor cannot stir without her, and we
have all come to depend upon her quick and ready judgment.
To-morrow the interest on the mortgage is due.
I know we have no money to meet it, no friends to assist.
Ah, me, I fear the house must go, and that I am convinced
would kill the doctor. (<i>Enter <span class="smcap">Lucy</span>, <span class="smcapuc">R.</span></i>)</p>

<p><i>Lucy.</i> Aunt Loring, I have come to you for advice.
Mr. Hastings sent me a note this morning, in which he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
declares his love for me, and asks me to become his
wife.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. L.</i> I have long suspected this would be the
result of his stay here. Does it surprise you, Lucy?</p>

<p><i>Lucy.</i> You know how persistently he has visited us
for the last three months, and how attentive he has been
to me. He is very agreeable, and&mdash;and&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Mrs. L.</i> You love him. Is that it, Lucy?</p>

<p><i>Lucy.</i> No, no! I do not, and I sometimes wonder
at myself: I like to be with him, he is so gay and so
attentive; but, when he begins to speak of love, I don’t
know why&mdash;but a face comes between his and mine, the
face of my dear brother Harry, and then I almost detest
him.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. L.</i> You do not believe him guilty of the charge
made by Harry?</p>

<p><i>Lucy.</i> I do not know what to believe: I only know I
wish he would never speak of love to me; but still&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Mrs. L.</i> Well, Lucy?</p>

<p><i>Lucy.</i> We are poor, very poor: this life we now lead
cannot last much longer. Some day this place must be
given up; then what will become of father, you&mdash;all of
us? Dilly works hard to keep the wolf from our door,
and I am but a poor drone in the hive. Mr. Hastings is
rich: were I his wife, this place might be secured, father
made comfortable, and you and Dilly happy.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. L.</i> And yet you do not love him?</p>

<p><i>Lucy.</i> No, no: I cannot while this uncertainty exists
about Harry.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. L.</i> Then do not marry him. A marriage without
love is a blasphemy; and a marriage with Fred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
Hastings could not be a happy one. Give him his
answer, plainly and fairly, and leave our fate to be
adjusted by a higher and wiser power. Hark! here’s
Dilly: do not speak of this before her; it would make
her unhappy.</p>

<p><i>Dilly.</i> (<i>Outside, <span class="smcapuc">C.</span></i>) Ha! Ha! Ha! what a queer
old doctor! you make me laugh so, my sides ache, you’re
so funny. (<i>Enter <span class="smcapuc">C.</span>, supporting <span class="smcap">Doctor</span>. <span class="smcap">Lucy</span> runs and
places arm-chair <span class="smcapuc">C.</span>, in which they seat him.</i>) There, I’ve
given you a good long walk; now be a good boy, be quiet,
and entertain me. (<i>Sits on stool at <span class="smcapuc">L.</span> of <span class="smcap">Doctor</span>.
<span class="smcap">Lucy</span> kneels, <span class="smcapuc">R.</span></i>)</p>

<p><i>Doctor.</i> Ah, Dilly, you’re a funny girl&mdash;a little rogue&mdash;you
want to keep me all to yourself.</p>

<p><i>Dilly.</i> Of course I do: ain’t you my cavalier, my
true and faithful knight, ready to break lances and fight
for me?</p>

<p><i>Doctor.</i> Yes, yes! ah, dear me, dear me!&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Lucy.</i> What’s the matter, father?</p>

<p><i>Doctor.</i> Ah, Lucy, my child, your father’s getting
old. I can’t tramp so far as I could once. Mrs. Loring?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. L.</i> Well, doctor.</p>

<p><i>Doctor.</i> Isn’t it most school-time?</p>

<p><i>Dilly.</i> (<i>Aside.</i>) Dear me, the school again!</p>

<p><i>Doctor.</i> You know we must be very prompt, or we
shall set a bad example.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. L.</i> You know it’s vacation now, doctor.</p>

<p><i>Doctor.</i> Dear me! so it is, so it is! strange I should
forget it. But isn’t it a very long vacation, Mrs. Loring?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. L.</i> About the usual time.</p>

<p><i>Doctor.</i> The pupils will be coming back soon, won’t<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
they? We must have every thing neat and tidy. Greenlake
Seminary must keep up its reputation. I shall be
glad to see the lads,&mdash;Hastings, Winders, and all the
rest of them. What rogues they are: I hope they’ll
behave better this term, and keep our Harry&mdash;no,
Harry’s dead.</p>

<p><i>Dilly.</i> O doctor! don’t talk about the school: let that
take care of itself. Talk to me.</p>

<p><i>Doctor.</i> Harry’s dead. What day is this, Dilly?</p>

<p><i>Dilly.</i> The 1st of August.</p>

<p><i>Doctor.</i> Harry’s dead. Five years ago; it was a beautiful
day when we buried him. Don’t you recollect it
Dilly: we placed a marble slab over him&mdash;we took it
from the village bank. I don’t understand why we did
that. Do you, Dilly?</p>

<p><i>Dilly.</i> No matter, doctor. Let’s talk of something
else: you know you promised me a sail on the lake this
afternoon.</p>

<p><i>Doctor.</i> (<i>Looking at his watch.</i>) Nine o’clock: come,
boys, to your places,&mdash;to your places. Master Root, you
were very imperfect in your history yesterday: be careful
sir&mdash;be careful. Master Hastings, why must I speak to
you so often about your grammar. Master Winders, you
were in Farmer Bates’s orchard last night. Harry,
Harry,&mdash;dear, dear, I forgot! Harry’s dead.</p>

<p><i>Lucy.</i> Dear father, don’t talk any more about Harry.</p>

<p><i>Doctor.</i> Why, Lucy, child, where have you been all
day? Where have you been?</p>

<p><i>Lucy.</i> I’ve been here, father, waiting for you.</p>

<p><i>Doctor.</i> Waiting for me? Why, I haven’t been away.
Yes, yes, I have: Harry drove me to the cars early this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
morning. I found something by the way,&mdash;this little girl
(<i>patting Dilly’s head</i>): her name’s “Bread on the
Waters.” That’s what Harry calls her. She’s going to
live with us,&mdash;ain’t you, little girl?</p>

<p><i>Dilly.</i> Indeed, indeed, I am, doctor.</p>

<p><i>Doctor.</i> Harry says, “Keep her, father, keep her;”
and Harry’s a good boy,&mdash;a good boy. Where is he
this morning? Why don’t you speak? Somebody run
and call him.</p>

<p><i>Dilly.</i> Why, doctor, you know he’s gone a long
journey.</p>

<p><i>Doctor.</i> Dear me! so he has, so he has,&mdash;a long journey
to the bank. He’s a good boy&mdash;a good boy&mdash;he’ll
be back soon.</p>

<p><i>Dilly.</i> Oh! why don’t he come? why don’t he come?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. L.</i> Dilly, Dilly, be calm.</p>

<p><i>Doctor.</i> Don’t be in a hurry, little girl. Don’t be in
a hurry (<i><span class="smcap">Fred</span> appears, <span class="smcapuc">C.</span></i>): all in good time&mdash;all in
good time.</p>

<p><i>Fred.</i> May I come in?</p>

<p><i>Lucy.</i> Mr. Hastings?</p>

<p><i>Dilly.</i> He here again.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. L.</i> Certainly, walk in.</p>

<p><i>Fred.</i> Ah! thank you, delightful morning, ain’t it.
You grow young, Mrs. Loring. Ah, Lucy! I hope I find
you well, and Dilly too. How’s my old friend the
doctor, this morning?</p>

<p><i>Doctor.</i> Ah, Butts, how are you?</p>

<p><i>Lucy.</i> You are mistaken father: it’s Mr. Hastings.</p>

<p><i>Doctor.</i> Ah! Master Fred, I’m glad to see you. Back
to school again, hey? Well, well, lad, be more careful
of your grammar this time. Study, boy, study.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Fred.</i> Of course I will. With so renowned a master,
as Dr. Harlem, I mean to study hard, and then I shall
be sure to succeed.</p>

<p><i>Doctor.</i> Come, Mrs. Loring, you see the boys are
coming back: let’s go and see if every thing is in order.
(<i><span class="smcap">Mrs. Loring</span> takes his arm.</i>) Greenlake Seminary has
a reputation to sustain. Come: good-by, Dilly.</p>

<p><i>Dilly.</i> Good-by, doctor. Now, don’t tire yourself,
for you must take me out for a sail this afternoon.</p>

<p><i>Doctor.</i> Yes, yes, when Harry gets back: you know
we can’t do any thing without Harry. (<i>Exit <span class="smcap">Doctor</span>
and <span class="smcap">Mrs. L.</span>, <span class="smcapuc">R.</span></i>)</p>

<p><i>Fred.</i> The doctor appears feeble this morning, Lucy.</p>

<p><i>Lucy.</i> Yes: poor father fails very fast. At times his
reason wanders, and for whole days he is as you have
seen him to-day.</p>

<p><i>Fred.</i> Poor doctor: is there no help for him?</p>

<p><i>Lucy.</i> None, I fear.</p>

<p><i>Dilly.</i> You are mistaken, Lucy. There is one thing
that would set him right.</p>

<p><i>Fred.</i> And pray what is that?</p>

<p><i>Dilly.</i> The return of Harry, with his innocence clearly
established.</p>

<p><i>Fred.</i> Ah, indeed! you know that can never be.</p>

<p><i>Dilly.</i> You think so?</p>

<p><i>Fred.</i> I know it. It’s no use now to mince matters.
Harry forged that check to get himself out of a scrape.
He will never return.</p>

<p><i>Dilly.</i> I think he will.</p>

<p><i>Fred.</i> You have great faith, Dilly.</p>

<p><i>Dilly.</i> In Harry? Yes. I believe him innocent;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
and I am sure the day will come when he will stand
beneath his father’s roof in the calm, proud consciousness
of vindicated innocence.</p>

<p><i>Fred.</i> You are a brave girl thus to stand by him,&mdash;a
convicted felon.</p>

<p><i>Dilly.</i> ’Tis false. He is no felon.</p>

<p><i>Fred.</i> His flight&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Dilly.</i> Was my act. Would I had never counselled
him to it! Had he remained, all would have been made
clear.</p>

<p><i>Fred.</i> Ah, you suspect&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Dilly.</i> Yes; but I do not accuse.</p>

<p><i>Fred.</i> Dilly, you are an enigma. Do you know that
doubting Harry’s guilt places me under suspicion?</p>

<p><i>Dilly.</i> Does it?</p>

<p><i>Fred.</i> Dilly, you surely do not suspect me?</p>

<p><i>Dilly.</i> Mr. Hastings, we will speak no more of this.</p>

<p><i>Fred.</i> But, Dilly&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Dilly.</i> I repeat, I accuse no one. The time will come
when all this will be made clear. We must wait.</p>

<p><i>Fred.</i> (<i>Aside.</i>) That girl <em>does</em> suspect me. (<i>Aloud.</i>)
You’re quite right, Dilly. It’s a disagreeable subject, and
unworthy our attention this bright, beautiful morning.
Come, Lucy, it’s too pleasant to be cooped up indoors.
What say you to a sail?</p>

<p><i>Lucy.</i> I shall be delighted to go. Dilly, will you go
with us?</p>

<p><i>Dilly.</i> Thank you; but I have something very particular
to attend to this morning. You must entertain
Mr. Hastings.</p>

<p><i>Lucy.</i> I’ll do my best, Dilly; and I won’t be gone
long.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Fred.</i> There’s a beautiful breeze on the lake.</p>

<p><i>Lucy.</i> I’m all ready. Good-by, Dilly.</p>

<p><i>Dilly.</i> Lucy, one moment.</p>

<p><i>Lucy.</i> Certainly. (<i>To <span class="smcap">Fred</span>.</i>) Will you excuse me?</p>

<p><i>Fred.</i> Oh, don’t mind me! I’ll stroll down the path
and wait. (<i>Exit, <span class="smcapuc">C.</span></i>)</p>

<p><i>Dilly.</i> Lucy, that man loves you.</p>

<p><i>Lucy.</i> I know it.</p>

<p><i>Dilly.</i> You know it? He has spoken then.</p>

<p><i>Lucy.</i> No. He has written, and now awaits my
answer.</p>

<p><i>Dilly.</i> And you, Lucy; do you love him?</p>

<p><i>Lucy.</i> Why do you ask, Dilly?</p>

<p><i>Dilly.</i> Because it would break my heart to know you
did. O Lucy! think of Harry, your dear brother, falsely
accused. Think of his words five years ago regarding
this man.</p>

<p><i>Lucy.</i> I do think of them, Dilly, often, very often;
and, remembering them, I can say to you, No, I do not
love him.</p>

<p><i>Dilly.</i> Oh! bless you for those words: they lift a
weary load from my heart. While Harry is away&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Lucy.</i> I am heart whole. I know your suspicions,
Dilly; and, till they are proven true or false, Fred
Hastings can have no claim upon me. Good-by! he’s
waiting.</p>

<p><i>Dilly.</i> Good-by, Lucy! (<i>Exit <span class="smcap">Lucy</span>, <span class="smcapuc">C.</span></i>) The time
will surely come, but when&mdash;when that old man tottering
on the brink of madness shall be in his grave, when
this loved home shall have passed from us, when old age
and gray hairs shall be upon us. Faith,&mdash;yes, I have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
faith; but this watching and waiting is weary and wearing.
No clew by which to work, nothing but bare suspicion;
and yet I have faith. This man Hastings, after
nearly five years’ absence, appears again among us. He
knows I suspect him; and yet he dares to woo the sister of
his betrayed friend. Oh! why <em>don’t</em> Harry come? If he
would only write; but no, no word, no sign. Pride keeps
him silent; but I know he will one day return. Heaven
grant it be not too late to save his father! (<i>Enter <span class="smcap">Butts</span>,
<span class="smcapuc">C.</span></i>)</p>

<p><i>Butts.</i> O Dilly, Dilly! such a crime! such an outrage,
a high-handed, diabolical assault on law and justice!</p>

<p><i>Dilly.</i> Why, Mr. Butts, what’s the matter now?</p>

<p><i>Butts.</i> Sh&mdash;! don’t speak so loud. We must be cautious:
my reputation depends upon it. I haven’t breathed
a word of this to a single person; but you know since the
time you managed to help Harry give me the slip, I’ve
had a great respect for you, and always come to you for
advice.</p>

<p><i>Dilly.</i> What is this new outrage?</p>

<p><i>Butts.</i> A forgery, a stupendous forgery.</p>

<p><i>Dilly.</i> Here in our village?</p>

<p><i>Butts.</i> No: in California.</p>

<p><i>Dilly.</i> California! What’s that to do with us?</p>

<p><i>Butts.</i> A great deal to do with <em>me</em>, Dilly; for I am
the humble individual destined to bring the perpetrator
to justice.</p>

<p><i>Dilly.</i> You, Mr. Butts?</p>

<p><i>Butts.</i> Listen, Dilly. Three months ago, the Malone
Bank of Sacramento lost twelve thousand dollars by the
payment of a check purporting to be signed by the firm<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
of Dunshaw &amp; Co., wine-merchants, presented by one
John Robinson a noted gambler and stock-speculator.
Three days after, the check was found to be a forgery.
In the mean time, the said John Robinson had embarked
in a steamer bound for New York. The firm of Dunshaw
&amp; Co. immediately offered a reward of five thousand
dollars for the arrest of the said John Robinson. I have
just received a note from some unknown party, giving
me the intelligence of the forgery, and acquainting me
with the fact that the said John Robinson is in this
vicinity. Five thousand dollars! Why, Dilly, I shall be
a rich man.</p>

<p><i>Dilly.</i> When you get the forger.</p>

<p><i>Butts.</i> Precisely. That won’t be long. I’ve got my
eye on him.</p>

<p><i>Dilly.</i> You suspect.</p>

<p><i>Butts.</i> Do I! I tell you, Dilly, when Butts gets his
eye on a culprit, there’s no escape.</p>

<p><i>Dilly.</i> Mr. Butts, didn’t Mr. Hastings come here
from California?</p>

<p><i>Butts.</i> He did. By the by, he might give me
information,&mdash;valuable information.</p>

<p><i>Dilly.</i> Suppose he should be John Robinson?</p>

<p><i>Butts.</i> Oh, pooh, pooh, Dilly. It isn’t possible. Suspect
him? why you’re not so sharp as I gave you credit
for. He’s here openly. Do you suppose John Robinson
would travel about in his original hair and whiskers?
No, John Robinson is disguised. I’ve got my eye on him.
There’s been a very suspicious character prowling about
the village for the last two days. It’s him, John
Robinson. But he won’t prowl much longer. Oh, no!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
Butts has his eye on him, Butts has his eye on him.
Good-by, Dilly! Don’t speak of this,&mdash;not a word, not
a syllable. Five thousand dollars! He’s trapped, he’s
trapped. (<i>Exit <span class="smcapuc">C.</span></i>)</p>

<p><i>Dilly.</i> This is very strange. Why should this John
Robinson come here? I wish this matter was in any
other hands than those of Mr. <em>Butts.</em> Zealous as he
appears, he was never known to ferret out any crime of
more importance than that of robbing an orchard. He’ll
be sure to make some mistake. (<i>Enter <span class="smcap">Mrs. Loring</span>, <span class="smcapuc">R.</span></i>)</p>

<p><i>Mrs. L.</i> I have persuaded the doctor to lie down,
Dilly. Can I be of any assistance to you?</p>

<p><i>Dilly.</i> No, thank you.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. L.</i> The interest on the mortgage is due to-morrow.</p>

<p><i>Dilly.</i> O auntie, I know it is; and we have not the
money to pay it. I know not where to go to procure it.
We must ask Mr. Hartshorn for further time.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. L.</i> I fear that will be useless. Mr. Hartshorn is
the principal of a rival seminary: he has long desired to
possess this place; and, I fear, will not let the opportunity
pass when he can procure it at a very low price.</p>

<p><i>Dilly.</i> Oh, do not say that, auntie! If he refuses,
who will aid us?</p>

<p><i>Bob.</i> (<i>Outside <span class="smcapuc">C.</span></i>) Just my luck! (<i>Enter, <span class="smcapuc">C.</span> with
carpet-bag.</i>) Halloo, here you are, here you are!</p>

<p><i>Dilly.</i> (<i>Rushing up, and seizing his hand.</i>) Why,
Bob Winders, you dear old fellow! where <em>did</em> you come
from? I declare I must hug you. (<i>Throws her arms
round his neck.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Bob.</i> That’s right, Dilly. Hug away. I like it: it’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
just my luck. (<i>Gives his hand to Mrs. L.</i>) Mrs. Loring,
I’m glad to see you looking so well.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. L.</i> Robert, welcome, a thousand times welcome.</p>

<p><i>Bob.</i> Well, now, that’s hearty. Dilly, how you’ve
grown! My eyes, what a bouncer!</p>

<p><i>Dilly.</i> Why, Bob, how <em>you</em> have altered!</p>

<p><i>Bob.</i> Altered. I suppose you refer to my weight.
“How are the mighty fallen!” Well, I flatter myself I
have altered, and for the better. It’s a deused sight
more comfortable; and there’s no end to the money saved.
Provisions have sensibly lowered in price, and the tailors
look decidedly gloomy, since I’ve donned this slender
habit. I’ll tell you how it came about. When I presented
myself to my respected parent on my return from
school, his first exclamation was, “Good gracious! how
fat that boy grows!” followed by a lengthy survey of my
by no means diminutive person. “This will never do,
boy: you must travel.” Being of an obedient disposition,
and being plentifully supplied with funds, I did travel.
I first attempted to cross the ocean, was shipwrecked,
and for twenty days skimmed the cold ocean in an open
boat, my daily food being one biscuit. It would naturally
be supposed that a loss of superabundant flesh would
follow. It didn’t. I increased in weight. Finally, after
much tribulation, I reached England. I was blown up
on the Thames: not an ounce of my flesh forsook me. I
was smashed up on a railroad. Flesh still immovable.
Paraded Paris, rushed into Russia, sighed in Siberia,
peeked into Pekin, leaned against the Leaning Tower at
Pisa, roamed in Rome, swam in Greece, picked a bone
in Turkey, and finally brought up in California, weighing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
twenty pounds more than when I left home. Just my
luck! But here Providence befriended me. I started
for the mines. Domesticated myself in a little place
called Leankin, was persuaded to run for office, and, by
the time the campaign was over, I was run with a vengeance,&mdash;run
out of pocket, run off the track by my
opponent, and run down to my present slender proportions.</p>

<p><i>Dilly.</i> O Bob! you’ve been unfortunate. I’m so
sorry!</p>

<p><i>Bob.</i> Unfortunate!&mdash;not a bit of it. When I’d
lost all my money, I fell in with my partner,&mdash;a glorious
fellow my partner. We worked in the mines together
till we had amassed a snug little capital, then started
business in San Francisco; and to-day there is no more
successful firm in California than that of Winders &amp; Co.</p>

<p><i>Dilly.</i> I’m so glad! But, Bob, have you no tidings
of our Harry?</p>

<p><i>Bob.</i> Harry! Why, Harry’s here, isn’t he?</p>

<p><i>Dilly.</i> Have you forgotten the events of five years
ago?</p>

<p><i>Bob.</i> Oh, I remember! Harry ran away to escape
being jugged by old Butts.</p>

<p><i>Dilly.</i> And you know nothing of him?</p>

<p><i>Bob.</i> Me! Why, bless you! how should I know any
thing about him? Hasn’t he been heard of?</p>

<p><i>Dilly.</i> Since that day we have never heard of or
from him. His poor father has been very ill, and now
is almost bereft of reason.</p>

<p><i>Bob.</i> You don’t mean it! This will be news for
Har&mdash;I mean my partner.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Dilly.</i> Your partner? What is this to him?</p>

<p><i>Bob.</i> Oh, nothing! only he is naturally interested in
any thing that interests me; that’s all.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. L.</i> Yes, Robert, your old master has seen sad
times since you left. This house is mortgaged, and
must now pass from him.</p>

<p><i>Bob.</i> No! You don’t mean it?</p>

<p><i>Dilly.</i> The interest is due to-morrow, and we’ve no
money to pay it. Oh, if Harry were only here!</p>

<p><i>Bob.</i> As he isn’t, let me be your banker. Here’s my
wallet: it’s in the condition in which I was five years
ago,&mdash;it’s overburdened, and wants tapping.</p>

<p><i>Dilly.</i> No, no, Bob! You are very kind; but we
have no claim upon you, and I could not think of taking
your money.</p>

<p><i>Bob.</i> Claim! confound it! Isn’t this the home of
my old master? and do you suppose I am going to stand
by and see it pass from his hands when I have plenty?
No, Dilly. Harry and I were brothers here at school;
and, when his father is in trouble, I’m bound to aid him
for the good he has done me, lickings and all.</p>

<p><i>Dilly.</i> Oh, no, no, Bob! do not ask me to take it.</p>

<p><i>Bob.</i> Well, then, I won’t. Mrs. Loring, who holds
this mortgage?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. L.</i> Mr. Hartshorn.</p>

<p><i>Bob.</i> Then I shall do myself the honor to call upon
Mr. Hartshorn, and put him in good spirits by paying
the interest.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. L.</i> O Robert! you have a kind heart.</p>

<p><i>Bob.</i> Have I? Well, I’ve got a full purse too, and
it’s pretty heavy; and, as I’ve got rid of heavy weights,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
if this doesn’t lighten soon, I shall throw it into the
lake.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. L.</i> Well, well, have your own way.</p>

<p><i>Bob.</i> I always did. It’s just my luck. I’m very
dusty. Shall I go to the old room?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. L.</i> Yes; and I’ll show you the way. O
Robert, Heaven will surely bless you. (<i>Exit, <span class="smcapuc">R.</span></i>)</p>

<p><i>Bob.</i> Bless her dear old face! Dilly, it does seem
good to be in this house once more.</p>

<p><i>Dilly.</i> O Bob, we’re so glad to see you! You
have comforted sorrowing hearts to-day.</p>

<p><i>Bob.</i> Have I? Well, that’s pleasant. But, Dilly,
where’s Lucy?</p>

<p><i>Dilly.</i> She’s on the lake with Fred Hastings.</p>

<p><i>Bob.</i> Fred Hastings! He here? Just my luck!</p>

<p><i>Dilly.</i> Lucy will be glad to see you, Bob.</p>

<p><i>Bob.</i> I hope she will, Dilly; for I’ve come a great
ways to see her. Good-by! (<i>Exit, <span class="smcapuc">R.</span></i>)</p>

<p><i>Dilly.</i> Good-by! Dear old fellow! how fond
Harry was of him! Ah, me! if Harry would only
come now! (<i>Turns, and meets <span class="smcap">Harry</span>, who has entered,
<span class="smcapuc">C.</span>, disguised as an old man, gray wig, beard, red shirt, and
sailor trousers.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> A morsel of food, I beg. I have travelled
far, and I am very hungry.</p>

<p><i>Dilly.</i> Hungry! Poor old man, sit down. I will
bring you some food. No one is ever refused in this
house. (<i>Exit, <span class="smcapuc">R.</span></i>)</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> Thanks, thanks! Heaven bless you! Home
again at last, after five long years; once more I stand
within the dear old house. How familiar every thing
looks! There’s the arm-chair in which father sat, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
little stool on which I nestled at his side, there’s Aunt
Loring’s knitting-work, and Lucy’s book,&mdash;every thing
just as it was in the old times; and that was Dilly, my
little Dilly, grown to woman’s estate. Oh! how I long
to clasp her in my arms! They told me I must not
come in here; but I could not help it. I <em>must</em> know if
I am remembered here, or if the bitter accusation
made against me has driven me from these hearts.
(<i>Enter <span class="smcap">Dilly</span>, with meat and bread, which she places on
table, <span class="smcapuc">R. C.</span></i>)</p>

<p><i>Dilly.</i> There, that’s the best I can do. You are
heartily welcome. Sit down, and make yourself comfortable.</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> Thanks, thanks! (<i>Sits <span class="smcapuc">R.</span> of table.</i>) I’m so
hungry! You have a kind heart, a kind heart, young
lady! Heaven will surely bless you for your kindness
to a poor old wanderer.</p>

<p><i>Dilly.</i> Now, don’t stop to be complimentary.</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> (<i>Pretending to eat, but watching <span class="smcap">Dilly</span> attentively.</i>)
May I ask whose house this is?</p>

<p><i>Dilly.</i> This is Dr. Harlem’s house.</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> Dr. Harlem, Dr. Harlem? Oh! I remember,&mdash;the
master of the seminary.</p>

<p><i>Dilly.</i> Are you acquainted here?</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> Long ago, long ago! In better days I knew
this place.</p>

<p><i>Dilly.</i> But you don’t eat.</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> Oh, yes! I do. I’m very hungry. Dr. Harlem,&mdash;he
was a kind, good gentleman.</p>

<p><i>Dilly.</i> Ay, that he was and is. But times have
sadly changed. Illness has almost unsettled his reason.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> (<i>Starting up.</i>) Gracious heavens!</p>

<p><i>Dilly.</i> How you startle me! What ails you?</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> (<i>Recovering himself.</i>) Nothing, nothing.
I’m very old, and the fear of losing <em>my</em> reason haunts
me. When you spoke of that old man, you startled
<em>me</em>. I beg your pardon.</p>

<p><i>Dilly.</i> Well, sit down. If you don’t eat, I shall fear
you are not pleased with what I have prepared.</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> But I do eat (<i>eating ravenously</i>); don’t
you see I do? I’m very hungry. (<i>After a pause.</i>) Dr.
Harlem,&mdash;are you his daughter?</p>

<p><i>Dilly.</i> Oh, no! His daughter Lucy is on the lake.</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> But didn’t he have a son?</p>

<p><i>Dilly.</i> Yes, he has a son.</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> Yes, yes, I remember!&mdash;a wild, reckless lad.
He was sent to prison. He was a forger.</p>

<p><i>Dilly.</i> ’Tis false! He was noble, generous, and
good; and those who dare accuse him of crime are base
slanderers.</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> (<i>Aside.</i>) She’s true, she’s true! (<i>Aloud.</i>) I
beg your pardon; I was told&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Dilly.</i> Told?&mdash;how dare you, beneath his father’s
roof, partaking of his charity, repeat this falsehood?
Oh, shame, shame, upon you!</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> I beg your pardon once more. It was ungrateful
in me, I spoke without thought. Forgive me,
I will go.</p>

<p><i>Dilly.</i> No, no, sit down! Forgive <em>me</em>; for it was
wrong in me to speak thus to one who never knew
Harry.</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> Ah! Harry has a warm friend in you.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Dilly.</i> I hope he has; for his kindness to me can
never be repaid. For five years, every thought of mine
has been to find some way to clear him, some way to
prove his innocence. But, alas! his father’s illness has
required all my attention; has kept me at his side: and
I have found no way to serve him.</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> If he is innocent, wait: the time will come
when the truth will triumph. Have faith, my child,
have faith.</p>

<p><i>Dilly.</i> I have, I have! But you’re not eating.</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> Oh, yes, I am; for I am very hungry.
Heaven bless you for your kindness to an old man
(<i>placing his hand on her head</i>), and bless you for your
trust in one who wanders through the earth with a blasted
name.</p>

<p><i>Doctor.</i> (<i>Outside, <span class="smcapuc">R.</span></i>) Dilly, Dilly, here, quick!</p>

<p><i>Dilly.</i> The doctor calls me; I must go. Now make
yourself comfortable; I’ll soon return. (<i>Exit, <span class="smcapuc">R.</span></i>)</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> My father’s voice!&mdash;sick, almost bereft of
reason; and I cannot go to him. The sight of me might
kill him. O false friend! the time will come, the time
will come! Heaven send it soon, or my heart will
break. (<i>Sinks into chair <span class="smcapuc">R.</span> of table, and buries his face
in his hands. Enter <span class="smcap">Butts</span>, <span class="smcapuc">C.</span>, very stealthily.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Butts.</i> Five thousand dollars! Now, who would imagine
that mass of hair and old clothes was worth five
thousand dollars? And yet it is. Once within the
clutches of this limb of the law, I’m a rich man.
Oh, ho, Butts, you’re a sharp one, you are! (<i>Strikes
his hand on table.</i>) Wake up, you’re wanted. (<i><span class="smcap">Harry</span>
raises his head.</i>) At last we meet.</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> Meet! Who are you?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Butts.</i> Oh, you don’t know me! Well, that’s not
singular; but I know you; I’ve had my eye on you:
you’re a deep one, you are! But I’ve got you! California
too hot, hey? Well, we’ll give you a warm corner
here, John Robinson. Oh! I know you: you can’t humbug
Butts. Suppose I should tell you just when you
left California, John Robinson? how much money you
took, John Robinson?&mdash;suppose I should lay my hand
on your shoulder, John Robinson, and say you are my
prisoner, John Robinson,&mdash;what would you say, John
Robinson?</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> That, if you lay a finger on me (<i>producing
a pistol, and presenting it</i>), I’ll blow what little brains
you have into yonder lake.</p>

<p><i>Butts.</i> (<i>Dropping under the table.</i>) Murder! put up
that infernal machine. Help, murder!</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> Shut up! If you speak again you’re a dead
man. Come out here! (<i><span class="smcap">Butts</span> obeys.</i>) Now take a
seat, and make yourself comfortable.</p>

<p><i>Butts.</i> (<i>Sitting <span class="smcapuc">L.</span></i>) Comfortable?</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> The tables are turned, hey, Butts?</p>

<p><i>Butts.</i> Oh, you villain, you villain! But you can’t
escape me; I’m an officer of the law; never known
to take a bribe. I believe in justice, and justice will
surely overtake you, John Robinson.</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> I sincerely hope I shall some day have justice.</p>

<p><i>Butts.</i> The hemp has grown, the rope twisted, that
will twist your little neck, John Robinson.</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> So you are Butts the thief-taker, are you?
Well, I’m glad to meet you. I’ve a little business with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
you. Butts, an officer of the law, who believes in justice,
and yet turned his only son out of doors.</p>

<p><i>Butts.</i> How! What do you know about my son?</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> I know that he is dead.</p>

<p><i>Butts.</i> Dead! My Bill dead!</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> Yes; it was my hand that closed his eyes,
away off in the mines of California.</p>

<p><i>Butts.</i> My boy dead!</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> He told me the story of his life. He loved
a poor girl, and his father turned him out of doors.</p>

<p><i>Butts.</i> She was a vile&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> Stop, Butts! She was a pure, noble woman:
her only fault was loving your scamp of a son. He
married her. I have his word for it and the marriage-certificate.
He married her nineteen years ago; took her
to the little town of Elmer, fifteen miles from here.
They had a child.</p>

<p><i>Butts.</i> A child! I never heard of that.</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> Oh! you was too busy looking after rogues.
You forgot your own scamp of a son. When the child
was four years old, the mother died, broken-hearted; for
your son was a villain. Bill determined to try his luck
in California. But the child was an encumbrance that
must be got rid of. So one dark night, Bill took her in
his arms, and started for his father’s house, to leave her
on the doorsteps. But Bill, not having led a virtuous
life, was wanted by certain officers of the law. They
tracked him. Bill found they were after him, and, with
fatherly care, flung his offspring by the roadside, and
fled. He died three months ago in California.</p>

<p><i>Butts.</i> And the child?</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> Ah! the child is safe.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Butts.</i> Thank Heaven for that! Where is she, my
grandchild?</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> Safe, I tell you. I, and I alone, know where
to find her.</p>

<p><i>Butts.</i> John Robinson, you’re a noble&mdash;no&mdash;I
mean you’re a&mdash;Oh! lead me to her. I’m an old man.
This child&mdash;I long to clasp her in my arms.</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> Lead you? Well, Butts, under the circumstances,
that is a very cool proposition. You forget: by
your own admission, I am your prisoner.</p>

<p><i>Butts.</i> You are free, only give me the child.</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> Five thousand dollars for John Robinson,
hey, Butts?</p>

<p><i>Butts.</i> If it were fifty thousand dollars, give me the
child, and you are free.</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> I’m astonished, Butts! you an officer of the
law, never known to take a bribe!</p>

<p><i>Butts.</i> Oh, curse the law! John Robinson, if you are
a man, lead me to that child.</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> On one condition, Butts.</p>

<p><i>Butts.</i> Name it.</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> There’s a man named Belmer stopping at the
village inn: bring him here in half an hour.</p>

<p><i>Butts.</i> And the child?</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> Bring Belmer here in half an hour, and the
child shall be placed in your arms.</p>

<p><i>Butts.</i> Bless you, John Robinson, you’re a trump!
I’ll be here in half an hour. Robinson, you’re a brick!
(<i>Exit, <span class="smcapuc">C.</span></i>)</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> So the train is laid. I’ll take myself off, lest
the sight of that dear girl’s face unman me. If all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
works well, when next I enter here none shall have
cause to blush for Harry Harlem. (<i>As he is about to exit,
<span class="smcapuc">C.</span>, he meets <span class="smcap">Lucy</span>, who enters, <span class="smcapuc">C.</span> He stands aside, bows,
and hurries out, <span class="smcapuc">C.</span></i>)</p>

<p><i>Lucy.</i> A strange old man! Who can he be?</p>

<p>(<i>Enter <span class="smcap">Fred</span>, <span class="smcapuc">C.</span>, <span class="smcap">Lucy</span> sits, <span class="smcapuc">R.</span></i>)</p>

<p><i>Fred.</i> Lucy, I entreat you unsay those words. Give
me at least the power to hope.</p>

<p><i>Lucy.</i> No, Fred: I am convinced a union between
us would be unhappy.</p>

<p><i>Fred.</i> But give me some reason, Lucy. You love
another?</p>

<p><i>Lucy.</i> No.</p>

<p><i>Fred.</i> Then why reject <em>me</em>? I love you truly, devotedly.
Become my wife; and, if you do not love me
now, I will find some way to make you.</p>

<p><i>Lucy.</i> No, Fred: I repeat it is impossible. My father
needs my care. Were he well, I think he would not
sanction it, and&mdash;and&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Fred.</i> Lucy, you are not just to me or your father.
He needs your care: he needs something more than
that. I know how his small fortune has gradually
dwindled away, that his house is mortgaged, that he has
not a penny in the world. Become my wife, Lucy. I
am rich. Give me the power to aid him?</p>

<p><i>Lucy.</i> No, no, Fred: better as it is. Dilly, Aunt
Loring, I, will work night and day to gain for him every
comfort.</p>

<p><i>Fred.</i> But think, Lucy. The best you can do will
only make him comfortable for a little while. With a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
pressing creditor like Hartshorn, this house must at last
be given up.</p>

<p><i>Lucy.</i> I know it must, I know it must. Heaven
help my poor father!</p>

<p><i>Fred.</i> I offer you my hand: accept, and to-morrow
the mortgage shall be paid, principal and interest.
See, Lucy, I’m at your feet. I love you truly, sincerely.</p>

<p><i>Lucy.</i> My poor father! What shall I do? oh, who
will aid us now? (<i>Enter <span class="smcap">Bob</span>, <span class="smcapuc">R.</span>, with fishing-pole, stumbles
against <span class="smcap">Fred</span>, who is kneeling.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Bob.</i> Just my luck! I beg your pardon. Why,
Lucy!</p>

<p><i>Lucy.</i> (<i>Rushing to him.</i>) Bob Winders, dear Bob,
how glad I am to see you! (<i>Throws her arm round his
neck.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Bob.</i> Just my luck! Why, Lucy, I hardly knew you.</p>

<p><i>Fred.</i> (<i>Aside.</i>) What sent him here at this time?
(<i>Aloud.</i>) Bob, old boy, where did you drop from? (<i>Gives
his hand.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Bob.</i> Why, Fred, is it you, still fluttering round the
old flame, hey? Where did I drop from? From the four
quarters of the globe. I’ve been in England, France,
Russia, everywhere, including California.</p>

<p><i>Fred.</i> California!</p>

<p><i>Bob.</i> Yes, California. It’s a fine place, California,
the Golden State. Lots of gold to be got by digging;
and, if you object to that, money can be easily got by
signing your name to a slip of paper. Just before I left, a
chap raised twelve thousand dollars by putting a name
to a blank check. But it wasn’t his name; ’twas the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
name of Dunshaw &amp; Co.: his was John Robinson.
“O Robinson, how could you do so?”</p>

<p><i>Fred.</i> It was discovered.</p>

<p><i>Bob.</i> Of course it was. Robinson sloped; but he’ll
be caught, he’ll be caught! Lucy, I see you are engaged.
I’m going out to try the trout. I used to like the sport;
and I rather think the trout liked me, for I never managed
to hook many of them. Just my luck! Good-by!</p>

<p><i>Lucy.</i> Oh, don’t go, Bob! I want to talk to you. I’ve
scarcely seen you.</p>

<p><i>Bob.</i> Well, there isn’t so much of me to see as there
was. But I’ll be back soon. (<i>Aside.</i>) There’s popping
going on here, so I’d best pop off. (<i>Exit, <span class="smcapuc">C.</span></i>)</p>

<p><i>Lucy.</i> The dear old fellow, Harry was so fond of
him! Don’t you think he has altered, Fred?</p>

<p><i>Fred.</i> Very much, Lucy. But he is still the same
blundering fellow he always was. But for him, just now,
I should have had your answer, I think your favorable
answer.</p>

<p><i>Lucy.</i> I have told you, Fred, I do not love you. Do
not, I entreat you, urge me to a course I know I should
regret. I would do any thing for father&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Fred.</i> Then marry me, Lucy. Give me your hand.
I will wait for your love.</p>

<p><i>Lucy.</i> To save my father, Fred&mdash; (<i>Enter <span class="smcap">Dilly</span>,
<span class="smcapuc">R.</span></i>)</p>

<p><i>Dilly.</i> Lucy, our old friend Bob Winders has arrived.
Have you seen him?</p>

<p><i>Fred.</i> (<i>Aside.</i>) Confound that girl! she’s always in
the way.</p>

<p><i>Lucy.</i> Yes, he passed through here just now: I never<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
saw such a change. (<i>Enter <span class="smcap">Doctor</span>, <span class="smcapuc">R.</span>, with the portfolio
used in Act 1.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Doctor.</i> Dilly, Dilly, don’t scold! I wandered into
your room in search of you. I picked up your portfolio;
and I want you to write to Harry.</p>

<p><i>Dilly.</i> Write to Harry?</p>

<p><i>Doctor.</i> Yes: write to Harry. Tell him to come
home: we want him. Don’t you understand, child?
Write, write, write!</p>

<p><i>Dilly.</i> (<i>Takes the portfolio. The <span class="smcap">Doctor</span> sits in an
arm-chair, <span class="smcapuc">L. C.</span></i>) What can I say to him, doctor?</p>

<p><i>Doctor.</i> Say&mdash;say? What can you say to Harry?
I believe the child is mad. Say that we want him here;
that his old father’s heart is breaking, breaking, breaking.
You want him, don’t you, Dilly?</p>

<p><i>Dilly.</i> Heaven knows I do!</p>

<p><i>Doctor.</i> Then write: quick, quick! (<i><span class="smcap">Dilly</span> sits behind
table, <span class="smcapuc">R. C.</span>, and opens the portfolio.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Fred.</i> Ah, Dilly, I see you still preserve my present
of five years ago.</p>

<p><i>Dilly.</i> Preserve it? Yes; but I have never opened
it. The memory of that day is not pleasant to recall.
Now, doctor, you shall tell me what to write.</p>

<p><i>Doctor.</i> Commence “Dear, dear Harry.”</p>

<p><i>Dilly.</i> Oh, of course! “Dear, dear Harry”&mdash; (<i>drops
her pen, starts, and remains with her hands clasped, her
eyes fixed upon the portfolio. Aside.</i>) What do I see?
am I dreaming?</p>

<p><i>Doctor.</i> Yes, “Dear, dear Harry.” He is dear,&mdash;my
own dear son. Who says he’s dead? It’s false: he
stood by my bed last night. Who says he’s a forger?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
’Tis false. He’s a good boy, a good boy&mdash;first in his
class&mdash;the largest number of credits&mdash;no checks for
Harry Harlem! Checks! they said he forged my name,&mdash;the
name of his old father; and they took him, put him
in prison, and hanged him by the neck till he was dead,
dead, dead. A forger! ’tis false, false, false.</p>

<p><i>Lucy.</i> Why, Dilly, what’s the matter?</p>

<p><i>Fred.</i> (<i>Approaching table.</i>) Dilly, child, what ails
you?</p>

<p><i>Dilly.</i> (<i>Starting up, and closing the portfolio.</i>) Away,
away!&mdash;you, of all men! I beg your pardon: I know
not what ails me. (<i>Takes portfolio, and comes down, <span class="smcapuc">L.</span></i>)
(<i>Aside.</i>) The proof, the proof at last! What shall I
do? who trust? I dare not leave Fred Hastings here
with Lucy: I fear his influence. Oh, if I could but make
the doctor understand!</p>

<p><i>Doctor.</i> Have you written, Dilly?</p>

<p><i>Dilly.</i> Not yet, doctor (<i>sits on stool at his side, <span class="smcapuc">L.</span></i>)
I want to talk with you first; I want to tell you a story.</p>

<p><i>Doctor.</i> But I don’t want to hear a story; I want you
to write to Harry.</p>

<p><i>Dilly.</i> Listen to me a moment, doctor. You’ll like
this story: it’s about a boy very much like Harry.</p>

<p><i>Doctor.</i> Then he was a good boy, a good boy!</p>

<p><i>Dilly.</i> Yes, he was a good boy until he gained a
friend, a false friend, who led him into temptation.</p>

<p><i>Fred.</i> (<i>Aside.</i>) What is the girl up to now?</p>

<p><i>Dilly.</i> This false friend taught him to gamble.</p>

<p><i>Doctor.</i> That wasn’t like Harry: he never gambled.</p>

<p><i>Dilly.</i> He lost a large sum he could not pay. The
false friend proffered assistance; gave him a check purporting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
to be signed by the boy’s father, with a very
plausible story to account for its being in his possession.</p>

<p><i>Fred.</i> (<i>Aside.</i>) What is she driving at?</p>

<p><i>Dilly.</i> The fraud was discovered; the boy punished.</p>

<p><i>Doctor.</i> The boy! It should have been the friend.</p>

<p><i>Dilly.</i> You’re right, doctor; it should. But the proof
was strong against the boy, and he suffered. Even his
own father believed him guilty.</p>

<p><i>Doctor.</i> False friend! false father!</p>

<p><i>Dilly.</i> But the boy had another friend, weak but true:
five years after, among the papers of this false friend,
she found the proof to clear the boy.</p>

<p><i>Doctor.</i> Proof! What was it?</p>

<p><i>Dilly.</i> (<i>Opening portfolio.</i>) It was like this, doctor.</p>

<p><i>Doctor.</i> Like this?&mdash;like this?&mdash;Why, I see nothing.
A portfolio blotting-paper!</p>

<p><i>Dilly.</i> But on the paper?</p>

<p><i>Doctor.</i> Marks, nothing but marks. Yes, yes, they
assume shape,&mdash;Aug. 1, Aug. 1. Gracious heavens!
what is this? what is this?</p>

<p><i>Fred.</i> I see it all. (<i>Rushes up, and seizes the portfolio.</i>)
Girl, girl, would you kill the old man? You
must not so excite him: no more of this. I’ll fling this
accursed thing into the lake. (<i>Runs up, <span class="smcapuc">C.</span>, and throws the
portfolio off.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Dilly.</i> What have you done? what have you done?</p>

<p><i>Fred.</i> Saved the old man from a fever. No more of
your confounded stories, Dilly.</p>

<p><i>Dilly.</i> Fred Hastings, you are a villain! In that
portfolio is the proof of your guilt: it shall not be destroyed.
(<i>Runs up, <span class="smcapuc">C.</span>; <span class="smcap">Hastings</span> seizes her by the wrist.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Fred.</i> Hold, mad girl! Hard words; but, for the sake
of the old man, I forgive you. If that portfolio contains
proof of my guilt, it’s too late now: it’s at the bottom of
the lake. Who can bring it thence? (<i>Enter <span class="smcap">Bob</span>, <span class="smcapuc">C.</span></i>)</p>

<p><i>Bob.</i> Just my luck! I knew that lake contained
bouncing trout; but I never knew before that it produced
any thing so nearly resembling a flounder. (<i>Holds up
portfolio.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Dilly.</i> It’s mine, mine, Bob.</p>

<p><i>Fred.</i> Curse that fellow! He’s always in the way.</p>

<p><i>Dilly.</i> Listen all. I charge that man Hastings with
the perpetration of the forgery of which Harry Harlem
was accused five years ago. The proof is here. On the
blotting-leaves of this portfolio once owned and used by
him are indelibly impressed the written lines of the
check,&mdash;“Aug. 1, 1858. Seventy-five&mdash;Andrew Harlem,”&mdash;left
there when he blotted the check. (<i>Enter
<span class="smcap">Mrs. Loring</span>, <span class="smcapuc">R.</span></i>)</p>

<p><i>Lucy.</i> Gracious heavens!</p>

<p><i>Mrs. L.</i> Is it possible?</p>

<p><i>Bob.</i> By thunder!</p>

<p><i>Doctor.</i> I don’t understand, Dilly; I don’t understand.</p>

<p><i>Fred.</i> You’re right, doctor: it is hard to understand,
especially as Harry and I were such good friends. We
used our writing materials in common. Of course, he
wrote the check on that portfolio; that’s plain.</p>

<p><i>Lucy.</i> Mr. Hastings, I remember the words with
which you presented that portfolio to Dilly, “Should I
ever become a great man, you can boast you possess
something which no one but I have ever used.”</p>

<p><i>Dilly.</i> His very words.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Fred.</i> You, too, turn against me, Lucy?</p>

<p><i>Lucy.</i> To clear a dear brother’s name, against you
and all the world.</p>

<p><i>Bob.</i> (<i>Aside.</i>) Ah, ha! I shall have her yet: it’s
just my luck.</p>

<p><i>Fred.</i> My friends, I pity your delusion. It is natural
we should stand by those we love; but this is a
clear case. Harry Harlem is now an outcast skulking
from justice, while I&mdash;Who dare accuse me of any
crime? (<i>Enter <span class="smcap">Harry</span>, <span class="smcapuc">C.</span>, disguised.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> Be that task mine.</p>

<p><i>Dilly.</i> That old man again!</p>

<p><i>Fred.</i> Yours! Pray may I inquire who you are?</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> One who for five years has watched your
course, knowing you to be a villain, waiting for the
proof; one who has watched you first squander the rich
inheritance of your father, then fall among the ruined
and degraded, living as a speculator and gambler; one
who has proof of your last crime, the forging of the
name of Dunshaw &amp; Co.,&mdash;the hunted felon under the
name of John Robinson. (<i>Enter <span class="smcap">Butts</span>, <span class="smcapuc">C.</span></i>)</p>

<p><i>Butts.</i> John Robinson here! then who the deuse are
you?</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> Belmer&mdash;did you find him?</p>

<p><i>Butts.</i> Mr. Belmer waits without.</p>

<p><i>Fred.</i> Belmer&mdash;that name! He here? Then I am
caught at last.</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> Yes: Belmer, the detective of Sacramento,
waits for you. Shall I call him in?</p>

<p><i>Fred.</i> No, no: I’ll see him outside. So, so! run to
earth like a fox! Well, I’ll put a good face on it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
Friends, I have a pressing engagement; will you excuse
me? I should not have come to this place; but&mdash;but&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Lucy.</i> Fred, Mr. Hastings, you once professed a
regard for me: if it was sincere, I beg you clear my
brother’s name.</p>

<p><i>Fred.</i> For your sake, Lucy, yes. I did forge the
name of Dr. Harlem to the check used by Harry.</p>

<p><i>Dilly</i>, <i>Lucy</i>, <i>Harry</i>. (<i>Together.</i>) At last!</p>

<p><i>Fred.</i> At last? (<i>To Harry.</i>) Who are you that
to-day stand forth as my accuser?</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> One who, after five long years of absence,
now stands beneath his father’s roof cleared of every
semblance of stain. (<i>Tears off his wig and beard.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Fred.</i> Harry Harlem!</p>

<p><i>Dilly.</i> (<i>Rushing into his arms.</i>) My Harry, my
Harry! Oh, welcome, welcome! Here, doctor, doctor,
Harry’s come! Harry’s come!</p>

<p><i>Doctor.</i> (<i>Starts up.</i>) Harry’s come! Where is he?
where is my boy?</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> (<i>Kneeling.</i>) Here, at your feet, dear father.</p>

<p><i>Doctor.</i> My boy, my dear boy, we’ve waited long
for you; but I knew that you would come.</p>

<p><i>Lucy.</i> Dear, dear brother! (<i>Embracing him.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> Lucy, best of sisters!</p>

<p><i>Bob.</i> Ladies and gentlemen, allow me to introduce
to you the junior partner of the firm of Winders &amp; Co.</p>

<p><i>Dilly.</i> Your partner!</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> Yes, Dilly, my true and fast friend. From
the day I left here, we’ve been inseparable. A true
friend, a true friend!</p>

<p><i>Fred.</i> If you will pardon me, I think I’ll go.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Butts.</i> I think you’d better. Mr. Belmer is very
anxious to see you.</p>

<p><i>Fred.</i> Butts, you’re a stupid old fool. (<i>Exit, <span class="smcapuc">C.</span></i>)</p>

<p><i>Bob.</i> He can’t help that: it’s just his luck.</p>

<p><i>Butts.</i> I think I’d better follow him.</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> No: Belmer will secure him. Never fear.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. L.</i> Harry, welcome home once more!</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> Ah, Aunt Loring, still as buxom as ever!
thanks, thanks!</p>

<p><i>Doctor.</i> Well, I declare I feel like a new man.</p>

<p><i>Dilly.</i> Ah, I told you Harry would make all right.</p>

<p><i>Doctor.</i> Ah, that he has. I’ll open school again.</p>

<p><i>Butts.</i> I say, Harry, you’ve no ill will against me?</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> Ah, Butts, I’ve no ill will against any one
now, I’m so happy.</p>

<p><i>Butts.</i> The child, Harry?</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> Dilly, how can I ever repay you for your
kindness to my father, for your faith in me? To you I
owe the good name I bear to-day: how can I repay you?</p>

<p><i>Dilly.</i> O Harry, you ask me that?&mdash;you to whom I
owe my happiness, this dear home, these kind friends?</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> Dilly, you have a relative living.</p>

<p><i>Dilly.</i> A relative?</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> Yes, a grandfather. Your father died in
California: I know his history. Your mother is also dead.
Your father’s name was William Butts.</p>

<p><i>Butts.</i> And I’m your grandfather. O Dilly, Dilly!
who’d have thought it?</p>

<p><i>Dilly.</i> You my grandfather!</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> There is no mistake: you are his grandchild.
I have the proofs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Butts.</i> Come right here and kiss me. Who would
have thought it? Why, Dilly, this accounts for your
being such a thief-taker: it runs in the blood.</p>

<p><i>Bob.</i> (<i>Aside.</i>) Precious little inheritance in that line
she received from you.</p>

<p><i>Dilly.</i> You my grandfather! Is it possible? Then
I am really somebody after all.</p>

<p><i>Butts.</i> Somebody? Yes, indeed! Grandchild of
Jonathan Wild Butts!</p>

<p><i>Dilly.</i> But I don’t want to be anybody’s grandchild.
Harry’s my father: I don’t want any other. And, if I
am to go away from here,&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> Don’t be frightened, Dilly. It’s a good thing
to know you have relatives; but I do not propose to
renounce my claim. You are my rightful property: I
found you by the roadside when deserted by your father.
I will still claim relationship; but, Dilly, it must now be
as your husband.</p>

<p><i>Dilly.</i> My husband!</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> Yes, Dilly, be my wife. I have had you in
my thoughts night and day for the last five years. You
have proved your love for me as a sister; now I shall
claim a dearer title.</p>

<p><i>Dilly.</i> O Harry, I do not deserve it!</p>

<p><i>Doctor.</i> She does, Harry; and, if you don’t marry
her at once, I will.</p>

<p><i>Butts.</i> What! rob me of my grandchild just when I
have discovered my treasure? I don’t like it.</p>

<p><i>Dilly.</i> Oh, yes, you do, grandpa! for I shall love you
dearly, I know; that is, if you let me have my own way.</p>

<p><i>Butts.</i> And that way is into the arms of a husband,
I suppose?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Dilly.</i> (<i>Giving her hand to Harry.</i>) So Harry says;
and I always do just what Harry tells me.</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> Dear, dear Dilly!</p>

<p><i>Bob.</i> So, Harry, you’re going to take a new partner
into the concern?</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> Yes, Bob: remember the Scripture injunction,
“Go, and do thou likewise.”</p>

<p><i>Bob.</i> Lucy, what say you? Will you take an interest
in the concern? The senior partner is desperately in
love with you.</p>

<p><i>Lucy.</i> O Bob, you’ve been a kind friend to my
brother Harry!</p>

<p><i>Bob.</i> That’s got nothing to do with it. I’m getting
rid of all superfluous stock; and I find I’ve got too much
heart. So I’ll throw it into the market. If you want it,
it’s yours at your own price. Yes: I’ll take yours, and
call it an even trade.</p>

<p><i>Lucy.</i> Well, I suppose I must say it’s a bargain.</p>

<p><i>Bob.</i> Thank you: we’ll just put a revenue stamp on
that contract (<i>kisses</i>). I’ve got the best of the bargain:
just my luck!</p>

<p><i>Doctor.</i> Ah, that’s right, that’s right! just as it
should be! We’re a happy family now, thanks to Dilly!
Ah! we have much to thank her for.</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> Ay, that we have! Father, your words have
come true at last,&mdash;“Cast thy bread upon the waters,”&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Dilly.</i> “For thou shalt find it after many days.”</p>

<p><i>Doctor.</i> Yes, yes: returning peace and happiness after
many days, after many days.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org/license

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
